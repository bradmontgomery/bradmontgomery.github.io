Those who know me know that I'm a huge proponent of Open Source Software. I use it daily, and the sheer number of quality open source projects just astounds me. The latest to do so is [OpenCV](http://www.intel.com/technology/computing/opencv/index.htm), a Computer Vision library originally from [Intel](http://intel.com).  
  
In a few weeks I will take my first steps into the world of computer vision, and like so many times before, an open source project will guide me. Awesome.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-71895340404933447?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
