Those who know me know that I'm a huge proponent of Open Source Software.  I use it daily, and the sheer number of quality open source projects just astounds me.  The latest to do so is <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/computing/opencv/index.htm">OpenCV</a>, a Computer Vision library originally from <a href="http://intel.com">Intel</a>.<br /><br />In a few weeks I will take my first steps into the world of computer vision, and like so many times before, an open source project will guide me.
