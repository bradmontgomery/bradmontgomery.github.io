I imagine that anybody who actually likes programming is familiar with the many popular scripting languages in use today. Of course, a lot of web devs and sysadmins have been using languages like [php](http://php.net), [perl](http://perl.com), and [python](http://python.org) for ages, but if you read any tech news (like [/.](http://slashdot.org)), you'll know that the newest craze is [ruby](http://ruby-lang.org). I've played with it a little, and I can actually see what the hype is all about... It's a neat language, and it [has a lot to offer](http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=links&tags=ruby).Though, as much as I've been wanting to really get my hands dirtly with ruby, I've recently been involved with a project that is heavily dependent on [tcl](http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=links&tags=tcl), and I have to admit... I'm beginning to really like it. Oh, it's syntax takes a little getting used to, but I think it's the simplicity of the language itself that I like. If you've been using any of the above languages, I'm fairly sure that you might have worked for a few days (or weeks) to get really comfortable, but it just seems like tcl is small enough to wrap your brain around in about a day, and be fairly productive... Now, I haven't gotten into tk, but I'm sure I'll be looking into that soon. Of course, take this for what it's worth.I've always liked [awk](http://www.google.com/search?q=awk).![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8826573165498854870?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
