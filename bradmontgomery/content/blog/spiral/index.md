I've recently grabbed the latest version of <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, (which resulted in the <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/images/Spiral.png">Spiral</a>) and I just have to say, &quot;WOW&quot;.  I'd played with the software about a year ago (maybe more), and it's amazing how far it's come.  Works perfectly on Windows and Mac OS X (<a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_osxX11">with X11</a>). If you like to use your computer to draw, <a href="http://www.inkscape.org/download.php">download Inkscape</a> now!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-505742650180080643?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
