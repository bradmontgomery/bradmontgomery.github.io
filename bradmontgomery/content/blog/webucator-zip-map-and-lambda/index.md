Recently, the folks from Webucator, who have a [series of python tutorials](https://www.webucator.com/programming/python.cfm) got in touch with me about one of my blog posts: [Python's zip, map, and lambda](https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/). They wanted to turn that article into a tutorial video.



I thought that sounded like a pretty cool idea, so if you're into video tutorials, give this a view. And check out some of their other tutorials as well.
