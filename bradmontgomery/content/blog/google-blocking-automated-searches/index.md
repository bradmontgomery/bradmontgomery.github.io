This morning I was writing a little python, and I used Firefox's Google toolbar to search for [isalnum](http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Disalnum%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dcom.ubuntu:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a). The strange thing about this, though, is that Google didn't do the search! Instead they gave me a message saying:  
  

> We're sorry...but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.

  
  
Luckily I could type in a [captcha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha) and continue the search. This really caught me offguard, though, so I decided to experiment a little. I had been logged in to my [gmail](http://gmail.com) account t the time, so I tried clearing the cookies and cache from my browser. I searched for "python isapha", and I got the same "We're sorry..." message. But this time, there was no captcha! I also tried searching for other terms (including "dogs"), all with same result.   
  
So what happens if I don't have a Google account? I suddenly can't use their search engine?  
  
So this got me thinking... Is the state of malware so bad that we'll eventually have to validate our identity before using a search engine?![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1740503720891335819?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
