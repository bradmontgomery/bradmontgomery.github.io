This morning I was writing a little python, and I used Firefox's Google toolbar to search for <a href="http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Disalnum%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dcom.ubuntu:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a">isalnum</a>.  The strange thing about this, though, is that Google didn't do the search!  Instead they gave me a message saying:<br /><br /><blockquote>We're sorry...but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.</blockquote><br /><br />Luckily I could type in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a> and continue the search. This really caught me offguard, though, so I decided to experiment a little.  I had been logged in to my <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail</a> account t the time, so I tried clearing the cookies and cache from my browser.  I searched for "python isapha", and I got the same "We're sorry..." message.  But this time, <span style="font-weight:bold;">there was no captcha!</span> I also tried searching for other terms (including "dogs"), all with same result.  <br /><br />So what happens if I don't have a Google account?  I suddenly can't use their search engine?<br /><br />So this got me thinking... Is the state of malware so bad that we'll eventually have to validate our identity before using a search engine?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1740503720891335819?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
