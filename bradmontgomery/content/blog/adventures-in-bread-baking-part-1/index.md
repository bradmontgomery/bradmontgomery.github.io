Last weekend I attempted to make Mark Bittman's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/081mrex.html?_r=1&ref=dining">Speedy No-Knead Bread</a>... sort of.  Being the adventurous experimenter that I am, I altered the ingredients:<br /><ul><li>2 cups whole-grain flour + 1 cup all purpose flour</li><li>2 cups of really warm water (instead of the 1.5 cups)</li></ul><br />I followed the rest of the recipe perfectly.  However, the results were really unsatisfactory.  The  center was super dense and gooey, and the bread had a really really hard crust (ok, I also cooked it an extra 30 minutes because of the gooey center).<br /><br /><em>I didn't take any pictures, because the results were so embarrassing.</em><br /><br />Here's what I learned:  <strong>Bread Flour != All Purpose Flour</strong> (for the non-programmer, that means they are NOT the same thing!)<br /><br />Fortunately, there are <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2316531_make-bread-flour.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.nestle.com/NutritionHealthAndWellness/Cooking/AskGilla/CookingTips/Bread+flour.htm">articles</a> <a hrer="http://smittenkitchen.com/tips/how-to-make-your-own-bread-flour/">online</a> that expound on the <a href="http://www.ochef.com/97.htm">differences between bread flour and all-purpose flour</a>.<br /><br />The secret is <em>wheat gluten</em> (or <em>gluten additive</em>).  Essentially, you must add 1tsp to each cup of all-purpose flour to create bread flour.  Unfortunately, this is not something I keep.  So part 2 will have to wait until I go shopping...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7762217279198189179?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
