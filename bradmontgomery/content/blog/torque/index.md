Well, I finally bought an <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/1">Indie Game License</a>  for the  <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/1"> Torque Game Engine</a>.  Like many young men over the past decade or so, I got into Computer Science thinking I'd like to create video games.   Maybe I'll finally get that chance!<br />My initial impressions with Torque are a little mixed though.  I can immediately see huge potention in the sort of things you can do without even touching the Engine itself... thanks to the built-in scripting language and the World Editor.  Given enough time, that's really all you need (tech-wise) to produde a fairly decent game.  However, I keep finding myself wishing that I was a 3D modeling guru (I've always wanted to play with <a href="http://blender.org/">Blender</a>!)  GG's got a some reasonably priced <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/developer/torque/contentpacks/">Content Packs</a>, but It'd be nice if there were some free basic models for a developer to play around with!  (A couple of vehicles, a few basic weapons, etc...) Maybe there are... but I haven't found them yet.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2019820102011954536?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
