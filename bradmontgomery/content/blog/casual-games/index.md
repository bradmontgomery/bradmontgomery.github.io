It seems like I keep running into this term, "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_game">casual games</a>."  Apparently this is a burgeoning industry with the advent of more advanced handheld devices (like cellphones).  There were even two keynotes (Trip Hawkins of<br /><a href="http://www.digitalchocolate.com/">Digital Chocolate</a>, and Robert Tercek of <a href="http://peoplejam.com/">PeopleJam</a> and GDC Mobile) regarding causal games at the recent <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference</a>.<br /><br />Basically, any simple (hopefully addictive) game that's quick and easy to learn falls in the category of a casual game.  Two of my favorite examples are <a href="http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?gamekey=atlantis2">Atlantis Sky Patrol</a> (from <a href="http://www.bigfishgames.com">Big Fish Games</a>) and <a href="http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=insaniquarium">Insaniquarium</a>  (from <a href="http://www.popcap.com">PopCam</a>).  [Side note: It seems like I remember playing insaniquarium before it belonged to a company... did I just dream this?]<br /><br />I don't where I read it, but I vaguley remember reading a quote somewhere that had something to do with casual games, and it said something similar to this, "If you don't think you're a gamer, it's just because you haven't found the right game!"[Another Sidenote: Basicially, these are the the types of games I would like write during my free time (if I had any!)<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7754127153775579701?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
