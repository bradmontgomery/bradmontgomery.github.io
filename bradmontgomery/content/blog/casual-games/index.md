It seems like I keep running into this term, "[casual games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casual_game)." Apparently this is a burgeoning industry with the advent of more advanced handheld devices (like cellphones). There were even two keynotes (Trip Hawkins of  
[Digital Chocolate](http://www.digitalchocolate.com/), and Robert Tercek of [PeopleJam](http://peoplejam.com/) and GDC Mobile) regarding causal games at the recent [Game Developers Conference](http://www.gdconf.com/).  
  
Basically, any simple (hopefully addictive) game that's quick and easy to learn falls in the category of a casual game. Two of my favorite examples are [Atlantis Sky Patrol](http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?gamekey=atlantis2) (from [Big Fish Games](http://www.bigfishgames.com)) and [Insaniquarium](http://www.popcap.com/launchpage.php?theGame=insaniquarium) (from [PopCam](http://www.popcap.com)). [Side note: It seems like I remember playing insaniquarium before it belonged to a company... did I just dream this?]  
  
I don't where I read it, but I vaguley remember reading a quote somewhere that had something to do with casual games, and it said something similar to this, "If you don't think you're a gamer, it's just because you haven't found the right game!"[Another Sidenote: Basicially, these are the the types of games I would like write during my free time (if I had any!)![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7754127153775579701?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
