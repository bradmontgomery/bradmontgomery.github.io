Apparently I've stumbled upon a problem that has recently faced many web developers.  That is, I would like to adopt an <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+open-source+web+development+framework&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a">open-source web development framework</a> for mid-sized project. Well... searching that phrase only yields 200,000+ results.  So how does one choose?<br /><br />I guess Ruby on Rails sparked the whole "Web Development Framework" movement (among other things). I've typically used PHP for my web-based projects in the past, but over the last 2 years, I've also become a huge fan of Python.  I'm not opposed to learning a whole new language (in fact, I'm quite for it!), but for this particular project, I'd like to stick with something I already know quite well.  So, that limits my languages to PHP and Python.<br /><br />Additionally, I would like that the framework support multiple databases on the back-end (especially SQLite!), and that there not be huge additional requirements to get things up and running.  I would also like it to integrate nicely with <a href="http://prototypejs.org">Prototype</a>, and, if it works on Mac OS X, that a huge PLUS!<br /><br />So, for the PHP side of things, my top three candidates were:<br /><ol><li><a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">symfony</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.xisc.com/">prado</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a></li></ol><br /><br />I've already started working through symfony's excellent tutorials, and there are two main reasons that I chose symfony to start with:<br /><ul><li>An <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/">online book</a> (and excellent Documentation)</li><li>An easy-to-use <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/installation/1_0">sandbox</a>.  This lets me get started quickly with it.</li></ul><br /><br />I've still got a soft spot in my heart for Python, and eventually, I'd like to let it into my Web Development world.  I've read good things about both <a href="http://turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a> and <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.  Interestingly enough, Django comes bundled with its own (lightweight) web server (for testing purposes), so it's a great candidate for anyone wanting a framework with little overhead...  It will probably be my overall number 2 choice.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8785207291593859662?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
