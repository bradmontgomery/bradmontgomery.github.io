With all the good FOSS CMS software out there (like <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>), I sometimes wonder why I take the time to "roll my own"...<br /><br />For all of you that subscribe to the feed (what, like 0), you might have noticed that it hasn't been updated lately.  That's because I wrote some stuff to put by blogs in a database (<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>! - overkill is good!), but I'm just now finishing it so that the feed gets updated.<br /><br />So, back to those CMS's... they all use PHP+MySQL, which is a good combination, but they're WAY more than I need! (Disregard the postgresql comment).  Is there a CMS/Blog system that's easy to install, has a simple back-end, and is geared to an individual?  Is anybody using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> to run their blog?<br /><br />Maybe I should clean up my code and open it up. Any takers?<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1802614619464063852?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
