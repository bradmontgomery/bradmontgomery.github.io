I like food.  I like to eat it... I like to make it.  <br /><br />A few days ago I got a craving for some chili, and I almost had all of the ingredients that I needed.  What I didn't have, was meat.  So, I decided to improvise, and what resulted was the recipe below.  It's sure to give all the gastric goodness of any other spicy bowl of chili!<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />1 can black beans.<br />1 can dark red kidney beans.<br />2 cans <a href="http://www.ro-tel.com/pages/products/extra_hot/index.jsp">RO*TEL extra hot</a> (good stuff!)<br />1 medium eggplant cut in small cubes.<br />about 1 cup of cubed cheddar<br />about 1 cup of sour cream<br />a hearty dash of chili powder.<br /><br />Rinse the beans, and put them in a pan with the RO*TEL and the eggplant. Place on Medium heat until the eggplant starts to soften, then add the cheese and the sour cream.  Once everything is all melted, it's ready to eat!  <br /><br />It's good with corn chips or crackers, and another dollop of sour cream doesn't hurt either.  Enjoy!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8252996560888481758?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
