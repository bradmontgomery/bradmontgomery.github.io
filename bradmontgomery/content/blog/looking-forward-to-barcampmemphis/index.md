[BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/) is coming to [Memphis](http://memphisbarcamp.pbwiki.com/FrontPage)!  
  
A project of [LauchMemphis](http://www.launchmemphis.com/), this is yet another event focused on growing the local tech industry. It follows the successful [Memphis Startup Weekend](http://memphis.startupweekend.com/) (which resulted in [Spynnr](http://spynnr.com/)).  
  
The theme of BarCampMemphis is **FLUX: Your Paradigm**, and from the [About BarCampMemphis page](http://memphisbarcamp.pbwiki.com/What+is+Barcamp+Memphis ):   

> In a constantly shifting environment, what do you do? Entreprenuers and businesses are constantly trying to walk the line between chaos and control, between the cutting edge and solid ground. Things are in FLUX. Now enter the world of technology; tried and true constants shift quickly and the market gives businesses and entreprenuers a choice: change or fail. BarCamp Memphis is designed to explore the awesome questions that affect you. Maybe you will find solid ground amidst shifting paradigms!

  
  
If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a BarCamp, check out [BarCamp.org](http://barcamp.org/) and [Wikipedia's BarCamp page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcamp), which starts with:  

> BarCamp is an international network of user generated conferences — open, participatory workshop-events, whose content is provided by participants — often focusing on early-stage web applications, and related open source technologies, social protocols, and open data formats.
