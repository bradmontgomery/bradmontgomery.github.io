<p>It's November. For many, that means a month of writing (<a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" _mce_href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>).
For others, that's a month of cultivating a fine moustache (<a href="http://us.movember.com/" _mce_href="http://us.movember.com/">Movember</a>).</p>

<p>I, however, am making an effort to become a better <a href="http://www.vim.org/" _mce_href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a> user. Call it
<em>NoVIMber</em> or <em>VIMmember</em> or whatever. I'll try to periodically blog about what I'm doing, but
I'm not making any promises (other than to force myself to be more productive).</p>

<p>I've been using vim for a long time (since grad-school... 2001ish), but for <em>far</em> too long, I've
just been using what I already know, rather than continuously learning. So here's how I'm starting out...</p>

<h2>Quicker Navigation</h2>

<p>I still use the mouse (well, magic trackpad) for a lot of things, so I've got a very bad
habit of using the arrow keys to navigate through a file. This is the slow way of moving around,
so for the last couple of days, I've been retraining myself to use vim's basic (better) navigation.</p>

<p>That's <code>h, j, k, l</code>&nbsp;(left, down, up, right) instead of arrow keys, and <code>w</code> (skip ahead by word),
and <code>b</code> (move back a word).</p><p> All of these commands also take numeric arguments:
<code>5j</code> to move down 5 lines; 
<code>3w</code> to move forward 3 words.</p>

<p>Effectively navigating withing a file using these commands makes for much
quicker editing. So, from here on out, if you see my with my hands on the arrow keys,
please call me out.</p>
