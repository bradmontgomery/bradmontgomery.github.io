It's November. For many, that means a month of writing ([NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/)).
For others, that's a month of cultivating a fine moustache ([Movember](http://us.movember.com/)).


I, however, am making an effort to become a better [vim](http://www.vim.org/) user. Call it
*NoVIMber* or *VIMmember* or whatever. I'll try to periodically blog about what I'm doing, but
I'm not making any promises (other than to force myself to be more productive).


I've been using vim for a long time (since grad-school... 2001ish), but for *far* too long, I've
just been using what I already know, rather than continuously learning. So here's how I'm starting out...


Quicker Navigation
------------------


I still use the mouse (well, magic trackpad) for a lot of things, so I've got a very bad
habit of using the arrow keys to navigate through a file. This is the slow way of moving around,
so for the last couple of days, I've been retraining myself to use vim's basic (better) navigation.


That's `h, j, k, l`Â (left, down, up, right) instead of arrow keys, and `w` (skip ahead by word),
and `b` (move back a word).

 All of these commands also take numeric arguments:
`5j` to move down 5 lines; 
`3w` to move forward 3 words.


Effectively navigating withing a file using these commands makes for much
quicker editing. So, from here on out, if you see my with my hands on the arrow keys,
please call me out.
