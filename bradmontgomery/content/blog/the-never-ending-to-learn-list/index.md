<b>I'm officially a student!</b> August marked the beginning of a new semester for me, and this time I'm a full-time student.  After being on the faculty side of things for a while, I'm actually having a great time being a student again.  One of the major benefits of being a student is that I'm actually getting to dive into that never-ending list of technology tools that I've been wanting to learn how to use!<br /><br />Just to name a few:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> - I'm writing as much code as I possibly can in Python.  I've used python minimally in the past, but it's actually nice to start working on larger projects using it.  I don't really like to get into religious debates about languages, but Python does feel nice!</li><br /><li><a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a> - I'm not building a game (yet), but it does make a nice foundation for putting  pictures on a screen!</li><br /><li><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm">PIL</a> - the Python Image Library offers an Excellent way to to Image manipulation!</li><br /><li><a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> - if you EVER need to build an event-driven network application from the ground up... use this!</li> <br /><li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> - GAhh!  Why haven't I learned this before... there's a lot to learn!</li><br /><li>Luckily, there's <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>!</li><br /></ul><br /><br />That should get me started!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-326716395189621856?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
