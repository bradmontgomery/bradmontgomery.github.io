<p>There's a lot of buzz on the net about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/business/steve-jobs-of-apple-dies-at-56.html" _mce_href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/business/steve-jobs-of-apple-dies-at-56.html">Steve Job's death</a>, and rightly so.  For those of us that work in or around the tech world, he was a giant. I fully attribute his company's products (the iPhone and the iPad) to what I like to think of as a renaissance in computing. These devices have changed the way we think about computers, the web, and what software can be—mobile &amp; fully integrated into our daily lives. And not just integrated because we have to use this software, but because we want to use it!
</p>
<p>So about Jobs. It's absolutely amazing to me just how many people admire his life and work. He's the quintessential example of the American Dream—something that I think most Americans have forgotten about. So what is it that makes him admirable?</p>
<ul>
<li>He was passionate about his work</li>
<li>He was uncompromising</li>
<li>He was tenacious. Indomitable.</li>
<li>He was hard-working.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't know for certain, but I suspect that Steve Jobs' guiding desire was not "to get rich". He wanted to change the world by changing the way people used computers.  There's a lesson to us all, here. We need to revive the American Dream, and it's guiding principle should be, "<em>Change the World. Think Different.</em>"</p>
