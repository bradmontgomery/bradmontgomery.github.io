<p>I've just released a simple little application called <code>pgSlideShow</code>.  It's a free image slideshow application written in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> using <a href="http://pygame.org">pygame</a>. It recursively searches a given directory for image files, and then displays them on a computer screen in Fullscreen mode.</p>
