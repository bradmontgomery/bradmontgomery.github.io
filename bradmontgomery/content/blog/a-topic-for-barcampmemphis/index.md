I've recently watched the [What is BarCamp](http://memphisbarcamp.pbwiki.com/BarCamp+Memphis+-+Amy) video, and I've been thinking about a [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)-related topic. I'm sure there are plenty of web developers out there looking for a better way...  
  
Now, I've only been using Django for about 5 months, but I'm pretty sure I could give any interested kindred souls a good jump-start. And so that's what I'd like to do... show by example.  
  
The Example? Why not a wiki... It's simple. (blog examples have been overdone)  
  
So there it is... Anyone interested in **0-to-wiki in 30 minutes**?![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7042306767709574258?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
