If you know me in person, then it's possible that you know I [have a thing about cycling](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1020859). And bikes. And shame on me for not writing about this stuff here. Anyway, a recent conversation among friends led me to thinking about the question: \*What is a reasonable number of bikes?\*

You see, among cyclists, there's the [N+1](https://www.bikeforums.net/fifty-plus-50/822639-what-does-n-1-rule-mean.html) debate. (it's not really a debate, you need N+1 bikes)

Anyway, when confronted with the question, here's my answer to this pressing question:

1. A road bike: In case you need to ride on the road.
2. A hard-tail mountain bike: For riding easy trails.
3. A full-suspension mountain bike: For proper mountain biking.
4. A commuter bike: because it's good for the environment.
5. A classic road bike: because steel is real.
6. A cruiser bike: For lazy days on shared-use paths/trails.
7. A tandem: because sometimes you need to take a friend out for a ride.
8. A gravel bike or cyclocross bike: Because these are things you should do.
9. One or two of the above for each child, spouse, or significant other.

Honorable mentions:

- an e-bike. maybe a cargo bike. Maybe a cargo e-bike. For proper transportation & moving things around.
- a BMX bike. That'd be pretty sweet.
- any sort of single-speed and/or fixed gear bike. Some people are into that.

Thoughts? Suggestions? What bikes do you own or strive to own? Let me know :)
