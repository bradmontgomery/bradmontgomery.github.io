<span style="float: right; padding: .5em;"><img src="http://bradmontgomery.net/files/thunderdemons.jpg" alt="Thunder Demons live here!"/></span>While walking across <a href="http://memphis.edu">campus</a>, I noticed this particular image attached to a large green box that I knew to contain electrical "stuff".  Now, I know the dangers of mixing humans with direct electrical current, but I'm not so sure this image evokes the correct message.  I'm not sure that a monstrous blob of electricity has ever actually jumped out of a box in order to heinously inflict harm to humans as they unknowingly walk by... I could be wrong, though.  Perhaps I should avoid that particular sidewalk next time I'm on campus.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8723962191521825126?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
