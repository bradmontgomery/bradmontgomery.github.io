![Thunder Demons live here!](http://bradmontgomery.net/files/thunderdemons.jpg)While walking across [campus](http://memphis.edu), I noticed this particular image attached to a large green box that I knew to contain electrical "stuff". Now, I know the dangers of mixing humans with direct electrical current, but I'm not so sure this image evokes the correct message. I'm not sure that a monstrous blob of electricity has ever actually jumped out of a box in order to heinously inflict harm to humans as they unknowingly walk by... I could be wrong, though. Perhaps I should avoid that particular sidewalk next time I'm on campus.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8723962191521825126?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
