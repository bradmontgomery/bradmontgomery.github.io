Occasionally, I need to crop some images. I suspect this happens to a lot of people,
and they simply use their favorite photo editor to perform the task. For a few images,
this works just fine. Plenty of people have
[Photoshop](www.adobe.com/products/photoshop),
the [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org),
or even [iPhoto](www.apple.com/iphoto/).


This past weekend, however, I found myself needing to crop about 1000 images,
and I need to do it quickly. This was more than my machine could load into the
Gimp at once. Even loading 100 at a time was a bit slow for me. So I set out to
find some simple tool that would let me JUST crop images. I found a few nifty
web-based tools ([picresize.com](http://www.picresize.com/) and
[resize.it](http://www.resize.it/)) that would allow me to easily
crop ONE image... but that's not really what I needed.


So, when I couldn't find what I needed, I wrote my own, and it's now
available under the ~~GPLv3~~MIT License. If you find
yourself needing to crop a large number of images, head on over to the
~~pyCropper page~~
[github repo](https://github.com/bradmontgomery/pycropper).
