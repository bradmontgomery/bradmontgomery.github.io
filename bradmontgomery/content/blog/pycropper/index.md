<p>Occasionally, I need to crop some images. I suspect this happens to a lot of people,
and they simply use their favorite photo editor to perform the task. For a few images,
this works just fine. Plenty of people have
<a href="www.adobe.com/products/photoshop">Photoshop</a>,
the <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a>,
or even <a href="www.apple.com/iphoto/">iPhoto</a>.</p>

<p>This past weekend, however, I found myself needing to crop about 1000 images,
and I need to do it quickly. This was more than my machine could load into the
Gimp at once. Even loading 100 at a time was a bit slow for me. So I set out to
find some simple tool that would let me JUST crop images. I found a few nifty
web-based tools (<a href="http://www.picresize.com/">picresize.com</a> and
<a href="http://www.resize.it/">resize.it</a>) that would allow me to easily
crop ONE image... but that's not really what I needed.</p>

<p>So, when I couldn't find what I needed, I wrote my own, and it's now
available under the <del>GPLv3</del><ins>MIT License</ins>. If you find
yourself needing to crop a large number of images, head on over to the
<del>pyCropper page</del>
