Well, I've tried to make some California rolls.  I think they turned out OK.  Not the prettiest rolls, but they tasted good... maybe I shouldn't have eaten them all, though!<br /><br /><img style="margin: 0.5em; float:left;" src="http://bradmontgomery.net/files/rolled_california_rolls.jpg" alt="rolled up california rolls"/><br /><br /><img style="margin: 0.5em; float:left;" src="http://bradmontgomery.net/files/finished_california_rolls.jpg" alt="finished california rolls"/><br /><br />These were made with the following ingredients: <ul><li>1 cup of rice. (most recipes call for short grain rice, but I used long grain rice)</li><li>1Tbsp of Rice vinegar</li><li>dash of salt</li><li>Nori</li><li>Carrots</li><li>Cucumber</li><li>Imitation crab meat (or real crab meat if you have it)</li><li>1 Avacado</li></ul><br /><br />Boil 1 and 3/4 cups of water and salt.  Once the water has come to a boil, add the rice, cover, and reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes. While simmering, julienne (or slice very thinly) carrots and cucumber.  Chop crabmeat.<br /><br />Once rice has finished, mix in the rice vinegar, and let cool for 10 minutes.  Spread a thin layer of rice on the Nori, and top the rice with a small amount of carrots, cucumber, and crab, then roll tightly.  Slice into thin pieces!<br /><br />Enjoy with wasabi, soy sauce and pickled ginger!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1071652847642456889?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
