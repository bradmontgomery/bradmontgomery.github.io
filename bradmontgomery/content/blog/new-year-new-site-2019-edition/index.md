So, it's a new year (happy 2019 everyone), and despite not publishing a single article in 2018, I've done a fair amount of work recently to update my site. Here's the quick & dirty rundown:

- I'm now running Django 2.1 with a nod toward [the next LTS release -- 2.2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#release-cadence)
- [django-blargg](https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-blargg) now only supports Django 2+ officially.
- There's still a fair number of pages powered by [django-staticflatpages](https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-staticflatpages/) which has also seen a recent update.
- I'm also using [Bulma.io](https://bulma.io/), of which I'm a huge fan.

That's everything that's noteworthy. Here's to more than zero blog posts in the next year (hey, I'm already at a 100% improvement over 2018)!
