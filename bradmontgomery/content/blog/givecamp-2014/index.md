This weekend is `GiveCamp Memphis <http://givecampmemphis.org/>`_, and I'm
pretty excited to be a part of it. It's hosted this year by
`Cowork Memphis <http://coworkmemphis.com/>`_, which is a pretty great local
coworking space.

If you're not familiar with GiveCamp, it's a weekend-long event where the
*technically-inclined* donate their time and skills to a select group of
local noprofit organizations. The end results may include anything from new
logos, to new web designs, to brand-new applications.

Even though this will be the third year for GiveCamp weekend, this will be my
first year participating. As far as I can tell, the overall goal is this:

**Help people be better at being awesome.**

I'm not exactly sure what's in store for the weekend, but I do know that
infrastructure won't be a problem thanks to the generosity of Rackspace.

Now, if you know me, you know I'm a fan of Rackspace's services (I've
`written in the past <http://www.rackspace.com/blog/work-for-pie-cloud-files/>`_
about `CloudFiles <http://developer.rackspace.com/blog/how-i-use-cloud-files.html>`_),
so I'm happy about having some free CloudServers to power a few local *Good Causes*.

If you haven't checked out Rackspace's offerenings lately, consider taking a
look at their `Developer Discount Program <http://developer.rackspace.com/devtrial/>`_.
You can get $300 in free cloud services ($50/month for six months).

To borrow the Rackspace tagline, *"Go make something awesome, on us"*:
