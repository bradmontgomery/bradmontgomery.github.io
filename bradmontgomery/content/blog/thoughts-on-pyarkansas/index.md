I make a decent effort to keep up with what's happening in the Python
comunity, but—*gosh darnit*—it's hard! I think that's why
conferences exist. They give you a day or two to focus solely on meeting people
and catching up with what's going on in the community.


I particularly like the smaller, regional events like the one I attended this
weekend: [PyArkansas](http://www.pyarkansas.org/). Here's a few
reasons why:


1. Cost: Smaller, regional conferences tend to be less expensive (*Free in
this case!*).
2. Travel: It's not thousands of miles away, so travelling isn't a huge burden.
*I rented a van, and took six of my good friends on a three-hour drive*)
3. Size: I think there were about 150 people there. Not too overwhelming, and
you can still meet a good deal of peple.


So... what did I learn?
-----------------------


This is a bit of a brain dump (*don't worry, it'll be short*), so
please forgive the terseness.


* If you work with [GeoDjango](http://djano.me/geodjango), you
 really need to keep up with [Adam Fast](https://github.com/adamfast)
* I'm a big fan of Django, but it's always nice to have
 [Kenneth Reitz](https://twitter.com/kennethreitz) challenging
 us to [re-think
 how we build web apps](https://speakerdeck.com/kennethreitz/flasky-goodness).
* [Gabriel Grant](https://twitter.com/gabrielmgrant) talked about
 [Stack.io](http://stackio.dotcloud.com/) and about building rich
 applications with Django using [Django REST Framework](http://django-rest-framework.org/) and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/).
 I'd seem Ember.js in passing, but somehow I'd completely missed (or forgot)
 about Django REST Framework.
* Unfortunately, I walked in late to
 [Jeff Bauer](https://github.com/rubic)'s talk on
 [Salt](http://saltstack.org/), but I caught just enough to really
 whet my appetite. I'm a Chef user, but salt seems to have a much lower
 barrier to entry, though I'm not sure it completely solves the same problems
* I also bumped into Larry Hastings. I'm not much of a podcast listener but
 I'd highly suggest checking out his podcast:
 [radio free python](http://radiofreepython.com/). It looks very
 well-done, and some quick google searchs seem to indicate his listeners
 think so, too. He also hooked me up with a cool sticker. Thanks, Larry!
* I also need to shout out to
 [Lyndsy Simon](https://twitter.com/lyndsysimon), who created both
 the PyArkansas and the [Work for Pie](https://workforpie.com/)
 decals in the swag bag. Great work! :)


I'm sure I missed meeting many other awesome people, too. If you've
never been to a regional conference like this, make it a point to go! You won't
be sorry.


Good Times!
