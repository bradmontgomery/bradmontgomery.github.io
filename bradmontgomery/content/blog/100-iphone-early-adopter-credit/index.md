There's been a lot of hoop-la about the steep price-drop of the iPhone, and a lot of people have widely ranging opinions about the $100 credit.<br /><br />Well, I (actually, my wife) willingly paid the initial price, and I've been absolutely happy with my iPhone!  I also grabbed my $100 credit.  All I had to do was hit <a href="http://apple.com">Apple's website</a> and type in  my phone number, and my iPhone's serial number.<br /><br />$100 is $100! Woot!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7952795941748667225?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
