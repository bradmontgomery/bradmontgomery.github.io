If you use [iPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/) on OS X, you've probably seen this: `Leopard libedit detected.`, and then noticed some very quirky behavior related to spacing, and command history. In short, that behavior is related to default version of the `readline` library bundled in OS X (It's not GNU readline). 


If you use pip and virtualenv, just instalilng readline doesn't help. So, how do you fix this?Â Well, the *quick and dirty* way to fix this is with:


```
easy_install -a readline
```
