Sunday afternoon was the `WORS 8K <https://wintercc.racesonline.com/>`_ at
Stanky Creek. I'd already spent most of the weekend working at
`GiveCamp Memphis <http://givecampmemphis.org/>`_, so I really didn't know
how well I'd fare during this race.

Turns out, it's possible to
`run an 8K quite well <http://connect.garmin.com/activity/443085806>`_ with
very little sleep!

I felt pretty good for most of the race. The weather was cool (36F) and the
trails were soppy, muddy, and slippery. There's really not much else to say
about this race, other than I'm really happy that I bought the
`Salomons <http://goo.gl/aqylpB>`_. They performed exactly as I'd hoped, keeping
me on track while many other runners were slipping and sliding all over the
place.

Next week is the 10K at `Shelby Farms <http://www.shelbyfarmspark.org/>`_
(another amazing place to run). I'm looking forward to the race, but I'm a
little bummed to see this series end. It's been a blast!
