So there was this little get-together called <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp">iPhoneDevCamp</a> last weekend (July 6-8, 2007), and since I'm just over 2000 miles from San Francisco, I missed out.  However, in just under a week, there seems to have been a flood of great iPhone applications.  To find out what I mean, just check out a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=iphone+applications&btnG=Search">google search</a>, OR, head right on over to the <a href="http://iphoneapplicationlist.com/">iPhone Application List</a>.<br /><br />So, in such a short time since the iPhone's release, how have so many applications been built?  I blame <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>.  His User Interface library, <b><a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a></b>, makes building basic apps for the iPhone a cinch. So what is iUI? Well, to quote from his <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php">blog</a>:<br /><blockquote><br />Its goal is simply to turn ordinary standards-based HTML into a polished, usable interface that meets the high standards set by Apple's own native iPhone apps.</blockquote><br />So, there you have it.  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/source">Try it out!</a>  I certainly will!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-324645953644061889?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
