The second annual HACKmemphis happened (is still
happening, actually) this weekend, and it's been a blast. I went into the event
with lots of ideas, but with very few expectations for myself.

My Goals: Hang out with friends (new &amp; old) and have fun.

**Mission Accomplished!**

I did build some stuff, too, so I feel pretty good about that. The stuff includes
a simple, fun little app, improvements to an Alfred Workflow, and some
improvements to Elvis, our community hubot.

1. Announcing, Echyo. This was a
 completely unplanned project, and was inspired by some conversations had on
 Friday night. If you're one of a select lucky few, this app with send you a
 Yo message when you @-reply to me on twitter.
 Amazing, right.
2. I've got an Alfred workflow (that is now mis-named)
 *percent change*. You can get it from Packal, but it
 lets you do percentage calculations easily. I added a few features this weekend
 and cleared up some bits that were confusing.
3. Our local irc channel (`#memtech` on freenode) has a
 hubot instanced named Elvis (what else!). I finally got a chance to (a) Fix a bug in a
 script that pulls from What's Brad Eating, and (b) modify our meetup script so that it'll
 just list the next upcoming tech event.

Long live: elvis meetup.

*Huge thanks* go out to all of the people that made this weekend possible,
especially the sponsors and to Cowork Memphis for hosting.
There was a ton of work that went into this, and I'm incredibly proud to be a
part of the Memphis Tech community.

The awesomeness isn't over yet, so watch along on twitter by following `#HACKmemphis` and `#memtech`.
