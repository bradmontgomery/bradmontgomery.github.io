The second annual `HACKmemphis <http://hackmemphis.com/>`_ happened (is still
happening, actually) this weekend, and it's been a blast.  I went into the event
with lots of ideas, but with very few expectations for myself.

My Goals: Hang out with friends (new & old) and have fun.

**Mission Accomplished!**

I did build some stuff, too, so I feel pretty good about that. The stuff includes
a simple, fun little app, improvements to an Alfred Workflow, and some
improvements to Elvis, our community hubot.

1. Announcing, `Echyo <https://github.com/bradmontgomery/echyo>`_. This was a
   completely unplanned project, and was inspired by some conversations had on
   Friday night. If you're one of a select lucky few, this app with send you a
   `Yo <http://www.justyo.co/>`_ message when you @-reply to me on twitter.
   Amazing, right.

2. I've got an `Alfred workflow <http://www.alfredapp.com/>`_ (that is now mis-named)
   *percent change*. You can get it from `Packal <http://www.packal.org/workflow/percent-change>`_, but it
   lets you do percentage calculations easily. I added a few features this weekend
   and cleared up some bits that were confusing.

3. Our local irc channel (#memtech on freenode) has a
   `hubot instanced named Elvis <https://github.com/memtech/memtech-hubot>`_
   (what else!). I finally got a chance to (a) Fix a bug in a script that pulls
   from `What's Brad Eating <http://whatsbradeating.tumblr.com/>`_, and (b) modify
   our ``meetup`` script so that it'll just list the next upcoming tech event.
   Long live: ``elvis meetup``.

*Huge thanks* go out to all of the people that made this weekend possible,
especially `the sponsors <http://hackmemphis.com/#sponsors>`_ and to
`Cowork Memphis <http://coworkmemphis.com/>`_ for hosting.
There was a ton of work that went into this, and I'm incredibly proud to be a
part of the Memphis Tech community.

The awesomeness isn't over yet, so watch along on twitter by following
