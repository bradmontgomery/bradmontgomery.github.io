<p>This post, a followup to <a href="/blog/sitesprint-iii-the-reclaimation/" _mce_href="/blog/sitesprint-iii-the-reclaimation/" style="" _mce_style="">my previous post</a>, is now about 2 months overdue. I have to admit, I'm glad I participated in <a href="http://sitesprint.info/" _mce_href="http://sitesprint.info/" style="" _mce_style="">SiteSprint</a>, but I'm fairly disappointed in the amount of work that I accomplished. So, without further ado, here's the update on what happened.</p><h2>Success!</h2><ol><li>Set up a Django stack running nginx, gunicorn, postgresql</li><li>Set up <a href="http://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine" _mce_href="http://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine" style="" _mce_style="">Mezzanine</a><br _mce_bogus="1"></li><li>Migrated my blog posts and comments from Blogger</li></ol><p>For a weekend of work, this really wasn't too bad. I like Mezzanine for publishing, and I like being in&nbsp;control&nbsp;of my own content and web stack again. &nbsp;I still have plans for integrating other apps for my own personal use, so having this stack available is worth a lot to me.</p><h2>Failure</h2><p>These are the things that I <em>knew</em> would be most difficult to accomplish.</p><ol><li>Design &amp;&nbsp;Typography.</li><li><em>Modern</em> HTML</li><li>Housecleaning - fixing imported blog posts</li></ol><p>I really don't like the current design of this blog. &nbsp;It's close to what I want, but not quite. &nbsp;The <a href="http://960.gs/" _mce_href="http://960.gs/" style="" _mce_style="">960</a>&nbsp;CSS framework comes bundled with&nbsp;Mezzanine, so I tried to use that. &nbsp;I'm much more familiar with <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" _mce_href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" style="" _mce_style="">Blueprint</a>, and at some point, I'd like to completely revise the layout and design of this site using it.</p><p>I actually did spend quite a bit of time reading about typography (specifically <a href="http://webtypography.net/toc/" _mce_href="http://webtypography.net/toc/" title="Go to table of contents">The Elements&nbsp;<span>of</span>&nbsp;Typographic Style Applied&nbsp;<span>to the</span>&nbsp;Web</a>). I think I learned quite a bit, but still just enough to know that for the most part, <em>I'm doing it wrong</em>. I'd like to remedy this, as typography is an incredibly important subject.</p><p>I'd also planned on using more modern markup for the layout of this site with elements such as &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt; for page layout and &lt;article&gt; for blog entries. &nbsp;In addition, many of the entries imported from Blogger are littered with horrendous markup. &nbsp;These posts really need to be cleaned up, especially since much of the code snippets are now completely unreadable.</p><p>So, as you can see, there's still a lot of work to be done, and I need to <em>buckle down </em>and get this stuff done.</p>
