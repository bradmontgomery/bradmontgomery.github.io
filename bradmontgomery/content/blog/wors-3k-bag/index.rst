Today, I completed my second-ever \*organized race\*. It was the
`Winter Off Road Race Series `\_ 3k in Overton
Park. The weather was pretty \*amazing\* (34ÂºF and raining), but I dressed
for it and had a great time.

Being only my second race, there's a few things that I thought were interesting
about this particular race.


1. Lots of kids! I was somewhat amazed at the number of kids that ran this race;
 many of them probably around 10-12 years old.

2. A surprising number of people under-dress for cold weather. There are always
 the \*tough\* people who run in freezing weather wearing shorts and short
 sleves, but I also saw a number of people who were probably wearing nothing
 more than tights and a light jacket. I heard lots of people complaining
 about the cold. Maybe I overdid it with \*longjohns\* and extra layers, but
 I felt quite toasty warm.

3. The were a \*lot\* of people at this race. I don't have an exact count, but
 there's definitely a thriving community of runners in the Memphis area. It's
 pretty awesome to be a part of it.

4. A 3k (~1.8miles) is a really short race. My typical run is usually about
 3 miles, so this went by really quickly. It \*did\* give me a chance to turn
 up the speed a little, which is something I rarely do.

I had a really good time running this race, and I'm looking forward to the next
in the series: A 5k at `Stanky Creek `\_.
