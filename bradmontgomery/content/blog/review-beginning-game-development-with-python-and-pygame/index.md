It's been out for a while now, and I'd always meant to write a review for this book... I pre-ordered it, and I've had it for a<br />while, but I haven't worked through the whole thing (though I've hit most of the latter chapters).  Actually, this is not really a review, per se... just my succinct list of pros and cons.<br /><br />So, without further ado:<br /><br />Pros:<ul><li>Very easy to read.</li><li>Great examples that actually work</li><li>Chapters 1 & 2 give a great intro to python, so this would actually be a good book if you've never touched python before (but did have some programming experience)</li><li>Lots of info using pygame+opengl</li><li>A lot of examples use his <a href="http://www.willmcgugan.com/game-objects/">gameobjects</a> library, so a lot of the grunt-work coding is available to use already.</li></ul><br />Cons:<ul><li>My biggest complaint is the lack of discussion on Sprites. Pygame is really a 2D library, and I think he left out a lot of very important information by not discussing how the Sprite class can be used.</li><li>Only cursory discussion Sound.  If you're writing a game and just want the basic sound effects and/or background music, this is ok. However, if you want to do something really interesting with sound, you'll need to dig way beyond what this book offers.</li></ul><br /><br />Overall, I think the book is worth getting unless you've already done<br />a few significant projects using pygame.  It's definately an Intro<br />book, and it does a really good job giving the user an idea how to put<br />a project together.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I'm a relative noob to pygame (~10 months), and I've been<br />using pygame for research projects in Augmented Reality (not<br />necessarily games) for both visual and non-visual (sound-only)<br />applications.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6224135340274907494?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
