It's been out for a while now, and I'd always meant to write a review for this book... I pre-ordered it, and I've had it for a  
while, but I haven't worked through the whole thing (though I've hit most of the latter chapters). Actually, this is not really a review, per se... just my succinct list of pros and cons.  
  
So, without further ado:  
  
Pros:* Very easy to read.
* Great examples that actually work
* Chapters 1 & 2 give a great intro to python, so this would actually be a good book if you've never touched python before (but did have some programming experience)
* Lots of info using pygame+opengl
* A lot of examples use his [gameobjects](http://www.willmcgugan.com/game-objects/) library, so a lot of the grunt-work coding is available to use already.

  
Cons:* My biggest complaint is the lack of discussion on Sprites. Pygame is really a 2D library, and I think he left out a lot of very important information by not discussing how the Sprite class can be used.
* Only cursory discussion Sound. If you're writing a game and just want the basic sound effects and/or background music, this is ok. However, if you want to do something really interesting with sound, you'll need to dig way beyond what this book offers.

  
  
Overall, I think the book is worth getting unless you've already done  
a few significant projects using pygame. It's definately an Intro  
book, and it does a really good job giving the user an idea how to put  
a project together.  
  
Disclaimer: I'm a relative noob to pygame (~10 months), and I've been  
using pygame for research projects in Augmented Reality (not  
necessarily games) for both visual and non-visual (sound-only)  
applications.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6224135340274907494?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
