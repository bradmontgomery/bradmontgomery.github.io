If you've known me for a while, you might know that I'm a runner. Since I live in (near) Memphis, TN it's hard not to get excited about the [St Jude Memphis Marathon](https://www.stjude.org/get-involved/at-play/fitness-for-st-jude/memphis-marathon.html). Surprisingly, this will only be my \*second marathon\*, and this year I've decided to run the race as a \*St. Jude Hero\*. 

\*\*What's a St. Jude Hero\*\*? Well, I've pledged to raise at least $1500 in donations for St. Jude, and I need your help! I've got a dedicated fundraising page at [heroes.stjude.org/bkmontgomery](http://heroes.stjude.org/bkmontgomery), and for this rest of this year, I've included a handy-dandy l ink to that page at the top of my siteðŸ‘†

If you're unfamiliar with St. Jude, they're one of Memphis' most-loved institutions. Here are a few quick facts:

- Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food â€” because all a family should worry about is helping their child live.
- Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since it opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude won't stop until no child dies from cancer.
- The daily operating cost for St. Jude is $2.2 million, which is primarily covered by individual contributors.

If you ask me, it's really hard \_not\_ to be on-board with a mission like that. Join me & let's help them continue their efforts to cure cancer for good.
