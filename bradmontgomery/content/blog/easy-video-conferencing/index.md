I just skimmed through the list of <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/printable/article/id,131935/printable.html">PC World's 100 Best Products of 2007</a>, and one of the things that caught my eye was <br /><a href="http://www.sightspeed.com/">SightSpeed</a>.  Apparently it's supposed to be the world's best video conferencing system. What interests me, though is the price (FREE!) and that it works on Mac OS X (and Windows). I'm going to give it a shot and see how it works.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1417110640401924205?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
