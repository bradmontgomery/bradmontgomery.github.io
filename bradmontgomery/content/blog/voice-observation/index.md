Apparently, I haven't quite beat the flu... or whatever it is that's making me cough.  So head over to my local Medical Practitioner and get a nice pharmaceutical conglomeration injected into my hip.  Apparently, I could also use some antibiotics, too... so I head over to walgreens and drop off the magical note that lets them know it's OK to give me drugs. I wait several hours, and then I discover that my insurance has rejected a claim... Uhm, OK.  So my first thought is "Did someone pull an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> maneuver on me and forget to tell me I don't have a job!"<br />I hope not.So, I call up my Insurance company to see if there's something wrong, and of course, I get an automated system.  However, instead of giving me a menu and letting me push a button, I'm greated by a voice that asks me to <b>speak</b> my responses to the menu... (like I'm a dog or something).  Some people call this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Voice (or Speech) Recognition</a>.  I didn't notice much recognizing though.  I guess computers aren't designed to interact with people who cough.  Basically the transcript of my conversation with the menu went like this:<br /><br />Menu: Do you need information about Health or Dental insurance?<br />Me: Health (cough)(cough)<br />Menu: I'm sorry, please say Health or Dental<br />Me: Health (I then turn my head away from the phone and cough)<br />Menu: Please say Health or Dental<br />Me: HEALTH<br />Menu: Did you say &quot;Start Over?&quot;<br />Me: Ahhh!<br /><br />Menu: Welcome to... *click*<br /><br />Yeah, I hung up the phone.  Well... actually I just hit 0, which normally bypasses the automated system and sends you right to an operator.  Unfortunately, their offices were closed.  I guess I'll just call tomorrow and try to see why my insurance was cancelled.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-5502284268658795751?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
