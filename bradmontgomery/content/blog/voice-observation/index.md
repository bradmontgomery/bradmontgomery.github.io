Apparently, I haven't quite beat the flu... or whatever it is that's making me cough. So head over to my local Medical Practitioner and get a nice pharmaceutical conglomeration injected into my hip. Apparently, I could also use some antibiotics, too... so I head over to walgreens and drop off the magical note that lets them know it's OK to give me drugs. I wait several hours, and then I discover that my insurance has rejected a claim... Uhm, OK. So my first thought is "Did someone pull an [Office Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/) maneuver on me and forget to tell me I don't have a job!"  
I hope not.So, I call up my Insurance company to see if there's something wrong, and of course, I get an automated system. However, instead of giving me a menu and letting me push a button, I'm greated by a voice that asks me to **speak** my responses to the menu... (like I'm a dog or something). Some people call this [Voice (or Speech) Recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition). I didn't notice much recognizing though. I guess computers aren't designed to interact with people who cough. Basically the transcript of my conversation with the menu went like this:  
  
Menu: Do you need information about Health or Dental insurance?  
Me: Health (cough)(cough)  
Menu: I'm sorry, please say Health or Dental  
Me: Health (I then turn my head away from the phone and cough)  
Menu: Please say Health or Dental  
Me: HEALTH  
Menu: Did you say "Start Over?"  
Me: Ahhh!  
  
Menu: Welcome to... \*click\*  
  
Yeah, I hung up the phone. Well... actually I just hit 0, which normally bypasses the automated system and sends you right to an operator. Unfortunately, their offices were closed. I guess I'll just call tomorrow and try to see why my insurance was cancelled.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-5502284268658795751?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
