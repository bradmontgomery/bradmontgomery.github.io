<p>My personal website is a disgrace.  As a web developer, I find it embarrassing that my own site is a cobbled-together mess of PHP and static html. Only slightly less embarrassing is my blog, which is obviously hosted on Blogger.  Even though Blogger has recently added a few new themes, I'm still unhappy with the look-and-feel of my blog.  So, since <a href="http://sitesprint.info/" _mce_href="http://sitesprint.info/">SiteSprint III</a> has officially started, I'm taking this opportunity to Reclaimâ„¢ my personal website.</p><h2>Tech Specs - the easy part</h2><p>I've thoroughly enjoyed using Django over the last couple of years, and as any self-respecting djangonaught would, I'm moving my site over to that platform.  Here's the planned tech:</p><ul><li>nginx + gunicorn + postgresql on rackspace cloud</li><li><a href="http://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine" _mce_href="http://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine">mezzanine</a></li><li>a revamp of my own <a href="http://bitbucket.org/bkmontgomery/django-notes" _mce_href="http://bitbucket.org/bkmontgomery/django-notes">django-notes</a></li></ul><h2>Design - the not so easy part</h2><p>I'm not a graphic designer by any means, but I know I can do better than what I've got.  I like Minimal designs, and I'd really like to focus on typography in my site.  I've still got a lot of homework to do here. I also want make use of as much HTML5 as is feasible.  In the next few days I'll be reading up on: </p><ul><li><a href="http://www.modernizr.com/" _mce_href="http://www.modernizr.com/">modernizr</a></li><li>font foundries (<a href="http://typekit.com/" _mce_href="http://typekit.com/">typekit</a>, <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/" _mce_href="http://www.typotheque.com/">Typotheque</a>, or <a href="http://kernest.com/" _mce_href="http://kernest.com/">kernest</a>)</li><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/typogrify/" _mce_href="http://code.google.com/p/typogrify/">django-typogrify</a></li></ul><p>Wish me luck, and feel free to point out any tools I might find interesting.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2770750782513065143?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" _mce_src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2770750782513065143?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
