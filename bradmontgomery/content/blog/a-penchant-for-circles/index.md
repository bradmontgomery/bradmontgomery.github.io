Apparently I like [Circles](http://bradmontgomery.net/images/Circles.png), as is evidenced by my latest desktop background. If you've looked through my [other background images](http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_Backgrounds), you'll notice that I also like a simple, unobtrusive image behind my work.   
  
After I created this one, it seemed to remind me of something... and after a little though, I remembered [Sacrifice](http://www.interplay.com/games/product.asp?Gameid=300), originally developed by [Shiny](http://www.shiny.com). I won't go into a long spiel, but it had beautiful graphics, a very interesting interface (once you got the hang of it), and quite possible some of the best AI that I've seen in a game for a while... not that I've actually played any games in a while.  
  
It's just too bad I'm the only person I know that played the game... it was nice.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-792965341397459849?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
