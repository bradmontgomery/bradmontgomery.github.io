Apparently I like <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/images/Circles.png">Circles</a>, as is evidenced by my latest desktop background.  If you've looked through my <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_Backgrounds">other background images</a>, you'll notice that I also like a simple, unobtrusive image behind my work. <br /><br />After I created this one, it seemed to remind me of something... and after a little though, I remembered <a href="http://www.interplay.com/games/product.asp?Gameid=300">Sacrifice</a>, originally developed by <a href="http://www.shiny.com">Shiny</a>.  I won't go into a long spiel, but it had beautiful graphics, a very interesting interface (once you got the hang of it), and quite possible some of the best AI that I've seen in a game for a while... not that I've actually played any games in a while.<br /><br />It's just too bad I'm the only person I know that played the game... it was nice.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-792965341397459849?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
