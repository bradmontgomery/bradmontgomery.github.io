Occasionally, I run across some project that's implementing an idea that I've had ... That's the case with <a href="https://www.youos.com/">YouOS</a>.  I think I even wrote a paper about it in 1998, but that's what happens when your lazy (read: too many other things you have to do!)<br /><br />I created an account, and though it was a little slow for my wife's laptop, YouOS is really a very impressive project.  Now, all the world needs is a very small OS that runs on every hardware platform (for connectivity/etc), and a very fast standards-compliant browser that runs on top of that (maybe the guys at <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">dillo</a> should reevaluate their roadmap); AND NOTHING ELSE!<br /><br />You know, I just had one other thought:  Maybe this is the GUI necessary for widespread use of <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan9</a>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6423307410317106736?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
