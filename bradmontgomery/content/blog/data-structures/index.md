Well, since I'm teaching a course in Data Structures this semester, I thought that I'd post some of the basic examples that I've given in class.  For now, you can find some source code under my <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_datastructures">Data Structurs Projects Page</a>.  All of the code is written in C++ and illustrates some simple data structures using the STL.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2895107757725929004?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
