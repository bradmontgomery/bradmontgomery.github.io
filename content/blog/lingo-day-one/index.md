## Day 1

I _installed_ (attached?) the Lingo CGM last night before going to bed. These are my thoughts for day 1.

### Installation

If you've seen ads for any of the GCM's, you've probably seen how easy it is to use one of these things. It comes
with an applicator and the process is basically:

1. unscrew the applicator lid
2. push the applicator into the monitor
3. push the applicator + monitor into the back of your arm.

It's as easy as that. I felt a slight prick on application, but honestly it wasn't painful at all. I had a weird
sensation on my arm for about two minutes afterward, but that could just be a weird _me thing_.

I slept with it all night, with no ill effects, and 12 hours later I didn't notice it at all.

Oh, and yes... I showered with it on. No big deal.

### Observations

It's only been one day, but I've already been surprised that my blook sugar seems to be fairly uneven, though
I'm pretty consistently in the 70-140mg/dL range that the app says is normal. Oh, and the app &mdadsh; it's really
well-designed (imho) and very easy to use, though it's crammed full of "easy-to-understand" health benefit videos
that tell you to eat more protein, eat more veggies, and lay off the donuts.

I have seen a spike at every meal today (breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner), though the biggest spike was at dinner where
I had a 130+ grams of carbs.

### Conclusion

So far so good... it's _intersting_, but I'm not yet sure how _actionable_ this information is. Let's continue &amp;
see what happens in a few more days.


P.S. My CGM showed up on a day that I also started feeling sick ‚òπÔ∏è, so I haven't incorporated any exercise yet. Hopefully
that happens soon. ü§û
