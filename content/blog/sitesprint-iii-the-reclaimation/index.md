My personal website is a disgrace. As a web developer, I find it embarrassing that my own site is a cobbled-together mess of PHP and static html. Only slightly less embarrassing is my blog, which is obviously hosted on Blogger. Even though Blogger has recently added a few new themes, I'm still unhappy with the look-and-feel of my blog. So, since [SiteSprint III](http://sitesprint.info/) has officially started, I'm taking this opportunity to Reclaimâ„¢ my personal website.

Tech Specs - the easy part
--------------------------

I've thoroughly enjoyed using Django over the last couple of years, and as any self-respecting djangonaught would, I'm moving my site over to that platform. Here's the planned tech:

* nginx + gunicorn + postgresql on rackspace cloud
* [mezzanine](http://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine)
* a revamp of my own [django-notes](http://bitbucket.org/bkmontgomery/django-notes)

Design - the not so easy part
-----------------------------

I'm not a graphic designer by any means, but I know I can do better than what I've got. I like Minimal designs, and I'd really like to focus on typography in my site. I've still got a lot of homework to do here. I also want make use of as much HTML5 as is feasible. In the next few days I'll be reading up on: 

* [modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/)
* font foundries ([typekit](http://typekit.com/), [Typotheque](http://www.typotheque.com/), or [kernest](http://kernest.com/))
* [django-typogrify](http://code.google.com/p/typogrify/)

Wish me luck, and feel free to point out any tools I might find interesting.
