**I'm officially a student!** August marked the beginning of a new semester for me, and this time I'm a full-time student. After being on the faculty side of things for a while, I'm actually having a great time being a student again. One of the major benefits of being a student is that I'm actually getting to dive into that never-ending list of technology tools that I've been wanting to learn how to use!  
  
Just to name a few:  
* [Python](http://python.org) - I'm writing as much code as I possibly can in Python. I've used python minimally in the past, but it's actually nice to start working on larger projects using it. I don't really like to get into religious debates about languages, but Python does feel nice!
  
* [Pygame](http://pygame.org) - I'm not building a game (yet), but it does make a nice foundation for putting pictures on a screen!
  
* [PIL](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm) - the Python Image Library offers an Excellent way to to Image manipulation!
  
* [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com) - if you EVER need to build an event-driven network application from the ground up... use this!
  
* [OpenGL](http://www.opengl.org/) - GAhh! Why haven't I learned this before... there's a lot to learn!
  
* Luckily, there's [PyOpenGL](http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)!
  

  
  
That should get me started!
