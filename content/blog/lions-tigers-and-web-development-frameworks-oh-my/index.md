Apparently I've stumbled upon a problem that has recently faced many web developers. That is, I would like to adopt an [open-source web development framework](http://www.google.com/search?q=+open-source+web+development+framework&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a) for mid-sized project. Well... searching that phrase only yields 200,000+ results. So how does one choose?  
  
I guess Ruby on Rails sparked the whole "Web Development Framework" movement (among other things). I've typically used PHP for my web-based projects in the past, but over the last 2 years, I've also become a huge fan of Python. I'm not opposed to learning a whole new language (in fact, I'm quite for it!), but for this particular project, I'd like to stick with something I already know quite well. So, that limits my languages to PHP and Python.  
  
Additionally, I would like that the framework support multiple databases on the back-end (especially SQLite!), and that there not be huge additional requirements to get things up and running. I would also like it to integrate nicely with [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org), and, if it works on Mac OS X, that a huge PLUS!  
  
So, for the PHP side of things, my top three candidates were:  
1. [symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/)
2. [prado](http://www.xisc.com/)
3. [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org/)

  
  
I've already started working through symfony's excellent tutorials, and there are two main reasons that I chose symfony to start with:  
* An [online book](http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_0/) (and excellent Documentation)
* An easy-to-use [sandbox](http://www.symfony-project.org/installation/1_0). This lets me get started quickly with it.

  
  
I've still got a soft spot in my heart for Python, and eventually, I'd like to let it into my Web Development world. I've read good things about both [TurboGears](http://turbogears.org/) and [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/). Interestingly enough, Django comes bundled with its own (lightweight) web server (for testing purposes), so it's a great candidate for anyone wanting a framework with little overhead... It will probably be my overall number 2 choice.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8785207291593859662?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
