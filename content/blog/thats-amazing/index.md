'Tiz the season... so today I went to Wal-Mart to get a [Pre-Lit Christmas Tree](http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3162815). I'm still a little amazed at how easy this thing was to assemble when compared to a real tree of the same size. Sure it doesn't smell like a real tree, but I don't have to worry about watering it so that it doesn't become a fire hazard. Besides, [the girls](http://thegirls.bradmontgomery.net/) really liked it, and that's all that counts! In fact, Dakota (3yrs) walked into the den, looked at the tree, and just said "That's Amazing". Where does she learn these things!
