Well, since I'm teaching a course in Data Structures this semester, I thought that I'd post some of the basic examples that I've given in class. For now, you can find some source code under my [Data Structurs Projects Page](http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_datastructures). All of the code is written in C++ and illustrates some simple data structures using the STL.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2895107757725929004?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
