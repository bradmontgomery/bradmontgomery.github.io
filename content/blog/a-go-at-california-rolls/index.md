Well, I've tried to make some California rolls. I think they turned out OK. Not the prettiest rolls, but they tasted good... maybe I shouldn't have eaten them all, though!

These were made with the following ingredients: * 1 cup of rice. (most recipes call for short grain rice, but I used long grain rice)
* 1Tbsp of Rice vinegar
* dash of salt
* Nori
* Carrots
* Cucumber
* Imitation crab meat (or real crab meat if you have it)
* 1 Avacado

  
  
Boil 1 and 3/4 cups of water and salt. Once the water has come to a boil, add the rice, cover, and reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes. While simmering, julienne (or slice very thinly) carrots and cucumber. Chop crabmeat.  
  
Once rice has finished, mix in the rice vinegar, and let cool for 10 minutes. Spread a thin layer of rice on the Nori, and top the rice with a small amount of carrots, cucumber, and crab, then roll tightly. Slice into thin pieces!  
  
Enjoy with wasabi, soy sauce and pickled ginger!
