I'll be honest; I was really excited about [Mailbox](http://www.mailboxapp.com/).
When I first heard about it, I'd become increasingly [Sucky at Email](http://markosullivan.ca/dont-suck-at-email/).
My inbox was a mess. I had **five** different kinds of flags/stars,
multiple kinds of **todo** flags, and I was one of those
*read-an-email-and-mark-it-as-unread* people.


So, when Mailbox showed up, I really did have high hopes that it'd help me
learn *A New Way* of managing email. I wanted to be productive.


But then, I had to wait for **a half million people**. Honestly,
had this not happend, I'd probably be a happy Mailbox user.


Instead, I stumbled upon [Keith Rarick](https://twitter.com/krarick)'s
email system: [Inbox Zero for Life](http://xph.us/2013/01/22/inbox-zero-for-life.html).
It's Gmail-centric and incredibly simple. I enabled keyboard shortcuts (that alone is life-changing),
ditched my varaious flags and todo labels, and in about an hour and a half on a Saturday
morning, I hit **Inbox Zero**. It was liberating.


I then picked up the [Gmail app for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gmail-email-from-google/id422689480),
which lets me more easily use the same technique on my phone. This makes me happy.


So, yesterday, I finally got access to the Mailbox app. I was still somewhat
excited to try it out, but it quickly became apparent that it just wasn't going to work.
The reason? It made things **More Complex**.


I went from having to deal with *Starred items*, to having multiple types of
todo lists (Later Today, This Evening, Tomorrow, To Buy, To Read, To Watch, Oh My!).
This felt like a step backward. On top of that, it just didn't feel right when I went
back to the Gmail web interface, which is where I read *most* of my email.
I'd finally found a system that really worked, and Mailbox disrupted it.
Seriously. I don't need these extra labels in Gmail:



```
[Mailbox]
    Later
    To Buy
    To Read
    To Watch
```

I *do* think Mailbox was a really well-written app. I like the aesthetic and
the interface. It just doesn't work with my preferred technique. So, after an hour
of using it, I deleted it from my phone.

**Update**: Mailbox is gone now, but the folks over at [mailbird](https://www.getmailbird.com) asked if I'd link to their article about what might have happened. And so, [here it is: what happened to mailbox](https://www.getmailbird.com/what-happened-to-mailboxapp-com/).
