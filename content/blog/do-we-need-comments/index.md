One of the things that I lost when moving this site over to a static site was 
the comments integration -- I was formerly using [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).  

I've debated on whether or not it makes sense to try implementing that here as well. Honestly, I got very littler interaction on this site, and it was either questions that I frequently missed or the random "OK, thanks" -- which is nice. I'm not sure independent writers like me even need comments, but it's a part of the early web that I miss, and one that I think has been killed off by social media. 

What do you think? Should this site even have comments? Let me know in the ... uhm. Social medias? Slack? Email? (please don't)
