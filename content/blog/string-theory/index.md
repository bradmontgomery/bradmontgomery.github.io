I'm not a physicist, but I've got some views on *string theory*
that I'd like to share. Here goes:



Brad's String Theory: Axiom I
While in motion, strings will become untied, regardless of advanced
techniques employed to fasten them.
Brad's String Theory: Axiom II
When at rest (i.e. upon completion of aforementioned motion), strings
will be resistant to any attempt at unfastening.

These statements are, to best of my knowledge, universally true, based on
my experiences during daily runs for the past few years.
