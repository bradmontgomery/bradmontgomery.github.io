This may come as a surprise, but I actually got into computer science thinking I would eventually find a job making computer games! What's more surprising, though, is that I've never even tried to write a game of any sort! There are plenty of places to start, I mean, there's only [11,000 game projecs](http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=80) on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net). Now, I'm guessing that about half of those are actually Libraries or Frameworks for developing games, and sometimes I wonder if maybe that's part of the problem... There's just so much to choose from, how do you pick one? Or should you just pick something like [SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) and see how far you can get with that before you need something else? And then what? Suppose you build a nice game (and is this even possible for a 1-2 person team)... Do you try to build a business and grab a piece of the billion-dollar entertainment industry? I wonder if the games like [Vendetta Online](http://www.vendetta-online.com/) produce any profits. Maybe it's time I start a company!Oh, and send a [Happy Birthday wish to my sweetheart.](http://rosemarie.name)!
