In a former life (*while a GA in graduate school*), I ~~was forced
to~~ had the pleasure to teach elementary and intermediate algebra.
These courses are essentially the algebra curriculum you *should* learn
during High School in the United States. Unfortunately, many college-bound
students don't master the material, and find themselves in a remedial class during
their college career. That's the class I was teaching.


There are many concepts that are difficult for students to understand, but
one of the most perplexing is the concept of *Division by Zero*.
Interestingly enough, *Multiplication by Zero* is relatively easy for 
students to master:`a × 0 = 0`


But what is Division?
---------------------


We start out teaching division by disguising it as a multiplication problem.



> `3 × ____ = 12`


Read in english, this is "three times what number is twelve?" Then, somewhere
along the line, we introduce this new notation:



> `12 / 3 = ____`


In english, this is "twelve divided by three is what number?" It can also
be read as "three times what number is twelve?" Hey! this is the same as the
equation above!


So, now we get to this:



> `5 / 0 = ____`


I've seen *so many people* answer this with "zero" (which is incorrect).
In english, we're asking, "zero times what number is five?"


This is essentially: `0 × ____ = 5`. This problem makes no
sense. It's analogous to asking "Which part of the turkey makes a spaceship?" (OK,
that's a bad analogy, but Thanksgiving was yesterday, and I like spaceships).


Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, there is no answer to this equation.
Mathematicians say the solution is [undefined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)).


I'm pretty sure these kinds of problems are just practical jokes played on us
by the Mathematicians of old.
