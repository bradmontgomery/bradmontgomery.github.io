So there was this little get-together called [iPhoneDevCamp](http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp) last weekend (July 6-8, 2007), and since I'm just over 2000 miles from San Francisco, I missed out. However, in just under a week, there seems to have been a flood of great iPhone applications. To find out what I mean, just check out a [google search](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=iphone+applications&btnG=Search), OR, head right on over to the [iPhone Application List](http://iphoneapplicationlist.com/).  
  
So, in such a short time since the iPhone's release, how have so many applications been built? I blame [Joe Hewitt](http://www.joehewitt.com/). His User Interface library, **[iUI](http://code.google.com/p/iui/)**, makes building basic apps for the iPhone a cinch. So what is iUI? Well, to quote from his [blog](http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php):  

>   
> Its goal is simply to turn ordinary standards-based HTML into a polished, usable interface that meets the high standards set by Apple's own native iPhone apps.

  
So, there you have it. [Try it out!](http://code.google.com/p/iui/source) I certainly will!
