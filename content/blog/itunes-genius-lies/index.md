![Top Songs Im missing?](http://bradmontgomery.net/images/topsongsyourmissing)   
  
I begrudgingly turned on the [Genius Sidebar in iTunes 8](http://www.apple.com/itunes/whatsnew/) and now it's showing me the "Top Songs You're Missing"... except, I'm not missing them! Surely Apple doesn't think I should purchase music that's already in my library!   
  
Maybe this is just a bug... or maybe iTunes is confuzed because my album is "Weezer (Blue Album)"... who knows.
