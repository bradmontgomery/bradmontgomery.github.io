I just skimmed through the list of [PC World's 100 Best Products of 2007](http://www.pcworld.com/printable/article/id,131935/printable.html), and one of the things that caught my eye was   
[SightSpeed](http://www.sightspeed.com/). Apparently it's supposed to be the world's best video conferencing system. What interests me, though is the price (FREE!) and that it works on Mac OS X (and Windows). I'm going to give it a shot and see how it works.
