# We're all inventors.

When I was young, if you'd asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, my most likely response would have been, "Inventor".

I idolized the "lone genious working in their garage" that were able to build something unique, useful, or amazing. I've
been working in tech now for over twenty years, and I've just realized that I've been living the dream.

It's not been quite what I expected, but kudos to all you inventors out there.
