One of my Favorite Mac Apps is [Grapher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapher). It lets you graph everything from simple 2D equations to complex 3D equations. For example, want to see all of the [Axes of symmetry for a cube](http://bradmontgomery.net/files/CubeAxesOfSymmetry.jpg)? Just enter the equations x=0, y=0, z=0, x=y, x=-y, x=z, x=-z, y=z, and y=-z, and voila!Pictures make math fun! You can also save these in .gcx files.
