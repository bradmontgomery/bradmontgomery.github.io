I think everyone is in agreement: [BarCampMemphis](http://barcampmemphis.com/) was a tremendous success!   
  
I want to personally thank everyone who came to my [Zero-to-Wiki in 30 minutes with Django](http://bradmontgomery.net/barcampmemphis/) session, and I also want to remind everyone that the Presentation and the code is freely available!  
  
There were many great sessions available throughout the day, but I want to list the ones I got to attend... all of which were just excellent:  
  
  
* [Dave Barger](http://www.linkedin.com/in/davebarger)'s [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/) tips
  
* Will Murphy's insights on what's changing on the web
  
* Scott Brown's Ruby on Rails demo
  
* The great thoughts on Game Design offered by Mike Rowe, Scott Brown, and Kyle Dempsey
  
* New insights on Etiquette in Social media moderated by [Spencer Dillard](http://www.spencerdillard.com/)
  
* And thanks to [Tollie Williams](http://tollie.org/) for a great list of iPhone Apps...
