## Hello Lingo

If you've paid any attention to heal &amp; fitness tech over the past few years, you'll know that 
CGM's (continuous glucose monitors) are all the rage. Their value prop is a simple one &mdash; monitor 
how the food you eat affects your metabolism (via blood sugar and insulin reponse).

I've been curious abou this tech for years, so I've finally decided to give it a shot. This will
be a series of posts highlighting my exeriences using the [Lingo CGM](https://www.hellolingo.com/)
device & app made by Abbot (the same folks that make the [Freestyle Libre](https://www.freestyle.abbott/)).

My guess is that the Lingo is a more _consumer-focused_ device that's geared toward diet &amp; exercise
than toward managing Diabetes. 

## Expectations

Here's what I'm hoping to understand.

1. What foods spike blook sugar, and how bad is it.
2. Do individual days on a _low-carb_ regimine actually have much impact on blood sugar.
3. Do products like [Ketone-IQ](https://ketone.com/) have any impact on what this sensor measures.
4. How do my on-the-bike activities (exercise) impact this as well.

I'm excited. I'm a nerd yes, but I think tech like this actually has the potention for HUGE benefits in our daily lives.
