[![Pink Ribbon for Breast Cancer](http://bradmontgomery.net/images/Pink_ribbon.png)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer) If you visit my site often (or even occasionally), you may have noticed a slight change. Well, it's sorta [Pink for October](http://pinkforoctober.org/), in honor of [National Breast Cancer Awareness Month](http://nbcam.org/). Also, my Mom's running in the [Little Rock Race for the Cure](http://www.ar-raceforthecure.org/)... Good Luck!
