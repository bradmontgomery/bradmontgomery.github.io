Wow... the Net never ceases to amaze me. I've been a fan of [Pandora.com](http://pandora.com) for a while, but I never realized they were using [OpenLaszlo](http://www.openlaszlo.org/)! So, after a skimming over the OpenLaszlo site, I ran across a link to [Gliffy.com](http://www.gliffy.com/) which bascially allows you to draw diagrams in your browser. Sweet!
