Well, I've finally grabbed a copy of the [IE7 beta](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx), and I have to admit that I'm impressed... although, I recognize features that are present in almost   
[every](http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/) [other](http://www.caminobrowser.org/) [browser](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) [I've](http://www.opera.com/) used. So far, I'm pleased to see that IE7 doesn't break too many of the sites that I've built, which make extensive use of CSS. I guess this just goes to show that competition DOES foster innovation.  
  
With IE7, I've also got my first look at [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/), which of course competes with [Google](http://google.com). One of the first things I noted about this site is the background image on the banner at the top of the page. I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out or not, but it has a striking resemblance to the default Mac OS X background ([look around here](http://store.apple.com)). Though I'm a relatively new Mac user, it seems like I'm seeing more and more things that are "borrowed" from [Apple](http://apple.com). Now, I've had a brief look at [Windows Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/), and I'll admit, there were some things that would seem awfully familiar to any OS X Tiger users... but I'll let someone else make a more extensive comparison.  
  
All in all, I have to commend Microsoft. At least they're paying attention.
