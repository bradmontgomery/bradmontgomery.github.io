Yesterday I discovered that Google knows who I am! This is surprising to me since, for several years, this site has never been displayed when searching for [Brad Montgomery](http://www.google.com/search?q=Brad%20Montgomery&sourceid=mozilla2&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8)! I have a Page Rank of 2! Apparently, I'm currently the 3rd most popular Brad Montgomery, right after [Brad Montgomery - The motivational Speaker](http://www.bradmontgomery.com/) and [his blog](http://www.bradlaughs.com/) (Both have a Page Rank of 4), and [Brad Montgomery - The Actor](http://www.brad-montgomery.com/). Surprisingly enough, Brad Montgomery - The Actor, only has a Page Rank of 1 (according to [Ran Aroussi's Page Rank Widget](http://aroussi.com/projects)) but his site is listed before mine!  
  
So, why my sudden popularity with Google? Who knows. Perhaps Google likes bloggers, and anything that looks like a blog gets ranked higher. So, due to my recent forays into the blogosphere, Google suddenly likes me. (Don't worry, see my 2006.05.25 post). It could also be that [some](http://www.destinationyoga.com/) [of my](http://savmorinteriors.com/) [clients](http://fitnessintheworks.com/theworks/) (and of course [my wife](http://rosemarie.name/)) link back to my page. I'm sure that helps.
