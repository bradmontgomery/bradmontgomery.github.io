I've always thought it would be fun to build video games, and when my daughters were born, I knew I would eventually want to build some simple games that they could enjoy while they're young. My original attempt at this lead me to [pygame](http://pygame.org), and the result was a simple alphabet/number game that plopped letters and numbers on the screen (very similar to [AlphaBaby](http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/), but not nearly as good!). Unfortunately, I never continued to develop that one.  
  
Since my oldest daughter (who is now 5) has recently discovered [GCompris](http://gcompris.net/), I thought I'd give the game-writing another chance. This has resulted in [dodger](http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_kidgames), which is also my first attempt at using [pyglet](http://pyglet.org/). I know it can't compete with GCompris, but hopefully my daughter will like it.   
  
I've released it under a [CC](http://creativecommons.org/) license, so feel free to grab a copy, play it, use it, learn from it or whatever... Enjoy.
