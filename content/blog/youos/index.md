Occasionally, I run across some project that's implementing an idea that I've had ... That's the case with [YouOS](https://www.youos.com/). I think I even wrote a paper about it in 1998, but that's what happens when your lazy (read: too many other things you have to do!)  
  
I created an account, and though it was a little slow for my wife's laptop, YouOS is really a very impressive project. Now, all the world needs is a very small OS that runs on every hardware platform (for connectivity/etc), and a very fast standards-compliant browser that runs on top of that (maybe the guys at [dillo](http://www.dillo.org/) should reevaluate their roadmap); AND NOTHING ELSE!  
  
You know, I just had one other thought: Maybe this is the GUI necessary for widespread use of [Plan9](http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/).
