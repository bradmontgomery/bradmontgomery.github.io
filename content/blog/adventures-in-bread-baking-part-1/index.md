Last weekend I attempted to make Mark Bittman's [Speedy No-Knead Bread](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/081mrex.html?_r=1&ref=dining)... sort of. Being the adventurous experimenter that I am, I altered the ingredients:  
* 2 cups whole-grain flour + 1 cup all purpose flour
* 2 cups of really warm water (instead of the 1.5 cups)

  
I followed the rest of the recipe perfectly. However, the results were really unsatisfactory. The center was super dense and gooey, and the bread had a really really hard crust (ok, I also cooked it an extra 30 minutes because of the gooey center).  
  
*I didn't take any pictures, because the results were so embarrassing.*  
  
Here's what I learned: **Bread Flour != All Purpose Flour** (for the non-programmer, that means they are NOT the same thing!)  
  
Fortunately, there are [several](http://www.ehow.com/how_2316531_make-bread-flour.html) [articles](http://www.nestle.com/NutritionHealthAndWellness/Cooking/AskGilla/CookingTips/Bread+flour.htm) online that expound on the [differences between bread flour and all-purpose flour](http://www.ochef.com/97.htm).  
  
The secret is *wheat gluten* (or *gluten additive*). Essentially, you must add 1tsp to each cup of all-purpose flour to create bread flour. Unfortunately, this is not something I keep. So part 2 will have to wait until I go shopping...![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-7762217279198189179?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com)
