About a month ago, I was cleaning out some old computer bins, and I stumbled across an old (2012) MacBook Air. I
started to chunk it in the trash (i mean, figure out how to recylce it responsibly), but I opened the thing up and
remembered just how a nice a form-factor the early Air's were. I mean that keyboard... it's way nicer the what we
have now.

This is my story.

## The hardware

- A 2012 MacBook Air, 13"
- CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3427U CPU @ 1.80GHz. 2 Cores, 2 threads.
- RAM: 4Gb  (yikes)
- Disk: 128Gb SSD (just over 120Gb are usable)
- Battery: It was completely dead. I could boot the computer while it was plugged in, but it would die immediately
  if unplugged. Good News! You can buy replacement batteries on Amazon &amp; they're super easy to replace.

## The OS

I decided to install [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), well because I heard it was nice. I put the installation
media on a USB drive and honestly, this was so stupidly easy I don't even remember it. I just followed all the default
recommendations.


## The Takeaway

I realize I'm using a 12-year-old piece of computing hardware. My expectations aren't exactly high, but this has been
an interesting experiment in trying to revive an old piece of hardware.

### The good

- It works!
- I have a full-featured command-line environment with lots of tools I know how to use.
- gvim is still a nice tool for development (my vim skills are a little rusty, but I'm getting there).
- The new battery makes this usable without being plugged in.

### The bad

- 4Gb is just really not enough.
- Opening more than 4-5 tabs in firefox is likely to completely lock up the machine.
- Trying to run VSCode (Flatpack) locked up the machine.
- Running to run the Slack app (Flatpack) locked up the machine.
- Turns out this thing actually has a fan and it can run pretty darn fast.

### Final thoughts

This thing basically feels like an under-powered Chromebook (but with firefox). It's perfectly fine for doing work on
the command line. Gvim works fine on medium-sized projects, but for any sort of heavy web-browsing it just doesn't work.

Even after following a number of steps from
[this post on improving Mint's performance](https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/speed-mint.html), it's still
not a great experience. I'll probably keep this for a while for light personal projects. I don't think I could use
this machine for _real work_. I need too many browser tabs for that.
