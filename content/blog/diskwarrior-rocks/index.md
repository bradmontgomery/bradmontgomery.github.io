...the title says it all. For just less than $90 USD, I've now recovered all of my priceless data for which I did not have the foresight (or time, or means, or whatever) to back up. If you're a Mac user, and you ever have a drive that stops working (or a [problem like mine](http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=701837&tstart=0)), head over to <http://www.alsoft.com/DiskWarrior/> and purchase a copy.
