## Who is this guy anyway?

**the obligatory 3rd-person and some links**

Brad Montgomery is a software engineer &amp; entrepreneur in Memphis, TN. He has years of software development experience, and is currently the Head of Engineering for Preteckt.

Brad has previously worked with organizations of various sizes operating in multiple domains including educational institutions, consulting firms, and silicon valley startups. He holds BS and MS degrees in Computer Science from Arkansas State University and is a Seed Hatchery alumni, where he co-founded the now-defunct technical recruiting startup, Work for Pie.

Brad believes in an agile-inspired approach to work, and he prefers open source tools. He has built numerous products with Python and Django, though he fully believes in using the right tool for the job (whether that's python, ruby, javascript, C, or a bash script).

You may also find me hanging out in various places across the web.
