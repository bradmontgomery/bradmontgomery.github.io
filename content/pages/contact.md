## Get In Touch

There are a number of ways to get in touch with me. Here are the best:

- You can also [send me an email](mailto:brad@bradmontgomery.net?subject=Hello from bradmontgomery.net).
- If you're a _phone person_, you can call (or text) my google voice number: (901) 730-6835. Do leave a message, though. 
- I'm active on the Memphis [`#memtech` slack](https://memphistechnology.org/blog/2015/05/19/join-memtech-on-slack-chat/), so you can always find me there.
