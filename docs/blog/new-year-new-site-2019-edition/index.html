<p>So, it's a new year (happy 2019 everyone), and despite not publishing a single article in 2018, I've done a fair amount of work recently to update my site. Here's the quick &amp; dirty rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm now running Django 2.1 with a nod toward <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/release-process/#release-cadence">the next LTS release -- 2.2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-blargg">django-blargg</a> now only supports Django 2+ officially.</li>
<li>There's still a fair number of pages powered by <a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-staticflatpages/">django-staticflatpages</a> which has also seen a recent update.</li>
<li>I'm also using <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma.io</a>, of which I'm a huge fan.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's everything that's noteworthy. Here's to more than zero blog posts in the next year (hey, I'm already at a 100% improvement over 2018)!</p>
