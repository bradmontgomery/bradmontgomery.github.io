<p>**(tl;dr) I installed django-channels and now my runserver command is very very slow. django-debug-toolbar was sort of the culprit (not really, because it was my own fault)**</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>I've just started a new project using <a href="https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">django-channels</a>. Websockets + channels is incredibly powerful, but I noticed something strange: While running django in debug mode, the development server was incredibly slow (on the average of 60s-90s per response).</p>
<p>After a bit of digging, it seemed that django-debug-toolbar was to blame, so I started turning off different panels to see what was the problem. Long story short: the <code>StaticFilesPanel</code> was taking a long time to generate it's data?</p>
<h2>Here's why</h2>
<ol>
<li>I'm building a chat app using react, and it's in a django app named <code>chat</code>.</li>
<li>I've organized my react app so that it's _inside_ my django app's static directory, e.g. <code>my\_project/chat/static/my\_react\_chat</code></li>
<li>As part of my front end development, I end up with a <code>node\_modules</code> directory with lots and lots of stuff.</li>
<li>In development, I'm using the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#std:setting-STATICFILES_FINDERS">default staticfiles finders</a> which will happily search through all of your django app's directories looking for static files. This takes some time when you a billion gigs worth of node modules.</li>
<li>Daphne's default timeout is 60s, and those static files finders take longer than that.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, for the moment, I'll either disable the <code>StaticFilesPanel</code> while I'm working on my react app, or I'll just try to remember to blow away my <code>node\_modules</code> directory when I don't need it.</p>
<p>I've probably not got my react development organized quite right when integrating with a django app, but I'm doing what makes sense to me. Perhaps I should see what everyone else is doing. <code>¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯</code></p>
