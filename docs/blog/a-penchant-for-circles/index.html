<p>Apparently I like <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/images/Circles.png">Circles</a>, as is evidenced by my latest desktop background. If you've looked through my <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_Backgrounds">other background images</a>, you'll notice that I also like a simple, unobtrusive image behind my work.</p>
<p>After I created this one, it seemed to remind me of something... and after a little though, I remembered <a href="http://www.interplay.com/games/product.asp?Gameid=300">Sacrifice</a>, originally developed by <a href="http://www.shiny.com">Shiny</a>. I won't go into a long spiel, but it had beautiful graphics, a very interesting interface (once you got the hang of it), and quite possible some of the best AI that I've seen in a game for a while... not that I've actually played any games in a while.</p>
<p>It's just too bad I'm the only person I know that played the game... it was nice.</p>
