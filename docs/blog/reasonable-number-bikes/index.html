<p>If you know me in person, then it's possible that you know I <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/1020859">have a thing about cycling</a>. And bikes. And shame on me for not writing about this stuff here. Anyway, a recent conversation among friends led me to thinking about the question: *What is a reasonable number of bikes?*</p>
<p>You see, among cyclists, there's the <a href="https://www.bikeforums.net/fifty-plus-50/822639-what-does-n-1-rule-mean.html">N+1</a> debate. (it's not really a debate, you need N+1 bikes)</p>
<p>Anyway, when confronted with the question, here's my answer to this pressing question:</p>
<ol>
<li>A road bike: In case you need to ride on the road.</li>
<li>A hard-tail mountain bike: For riding easy trails.</li>
<li>A full-suspension mountain bike: For proper mountain biking.</li>
<li>A commuter bike: because it's good for the environment.</li>
<li>A classic road bike: because steel is real.</li>
<li>A cruiser bike: For lazy days on shared-use paths/trails.</li>
<li>A tandem: because sometimes you need to take a friend out for a ride.</li>
<li>A gravel bike or cyclocross bike: Because these are things you should do.</li>
<li>One or two of the above for each child, spouse, or significant other.</li>
</ol>
<p>Honorable mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li>an e-bike. maybe a cargo bike. Maybe a cargo e-bike. For proper transportation &amp; moving things around.</li>
<li>a BMX bike. That'd be pretty sweet.</li>
<li>any sort of single-speed and/or fixed gear bike. Some people are into that.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thoughts? Suggestions? What bikes do you own or strive to own? Let me know :)</p>
