<p>Recently, the folks from Webucator, who have a <a href="https://www.webucator.com/programming/python.cfm">series of python tutorials</a> got in touch with me about one of my blog posts: <a href="https://bradmontgomery.net/blog/pythons-zip-map-and-lambda/">Python's zip, map, and lambda</a>. They wanted to turn that article into a tutorial video.</p>
<p>I thought that sounded like a pretty cool idea, so if you're into video tutorials, give this a view. And check out some of their other tutorials as well.</p>
