<p>I picked up the <a href="https://www.zombiesrungame.com/">Zombies, Run!</a> app today, and I'm pretty excited about it. If you haven't heard about it, check out their video:</p>
<p>I've only had one run with the game, but the story felt very well-done, and I really like how they've added an extra element of fun to my run. Of course, I'm a fan of all things &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse#Zombie_apocalypse">Zombie Apocalypse</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>If you do <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zombies-run!/id503519713">pick up a copy</a>, spend some time setting up a decent play list. The story unfolds in small bits of dialog, but then launches into your own music. You'll hear a bit more of the story between each song.</p>
<p>I'm pretty happy about my playlist, even though I only got through the first 17 songs today. Here it is:</p>

<h2>Complaints</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Missions don't auto-progress</strong>. After you finish a mission, the app enters &quot;radio mode&quot;. This means it plays music interspersed with dialog. I like this mode, but I wish I had a way to tell the game to just move to the next mission once I finished on. I mean, I did an 8 mile run, and I only completed two missions! <code>:-(</code></li>
<li><strong>The audio mix is buggy</strong>. I don't know if anyone else has had this problem, but during the second mission, the audio started acting funny. I could hear the dialog just fine, but once a song started playing, the audio was really suppressed until I picked up some supplies. At that point, my music played at a normal volume. This was really annoying because I either had to fumble with the volume on my phone or go halfway through a song without being able to hear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Takeaway</h2>
<p>I like the game. It's a neat idea, and I'm pretty curious to see how it unfolds. I'd already been running, but this will definitely make me look forward to that next run just a bit more. If you don't run, it could still be a fun game. Got for a 15 minute walk and give it a try <code>:)</code></p>
<h2>PS:</h2>
<p>You can export a playlist in iTunes. Just right-click on the playlist, then choose <em>Export</em> and save it in a plain text file. You get lots of information about each song, but I pulled out the bits I wanted with this awk command:</p>
<pre><code>awk -F\t '{print $1, &quot; --- &quot; $2, &quot; --- &quot;, $8 }' Zombies.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Also, here's a map of my run.</p>
