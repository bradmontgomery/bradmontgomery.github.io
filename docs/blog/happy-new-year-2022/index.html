<p>_Editor's note: I've actually been sitting on this post for a few weeks trying to determine if it really says what I want it to. I'm now at the point where I just want to put it out there. Enjoy._</p>
<hr />
<p>What a weird a couple of years. Pandemic. Crazy weather. Inflation gone wild (lol money). Turmoil in the world everywhere.</p>
<p>I want to write a “new year’s” blog post, but I honestly have no idea where to start or what to say. So I’ll try to be optimistic and highlight some of the good stuff.</p>
<h2>Professionally.</h2>
<p>Professionally I’m doing ok. Despite still working for a startup, <a href="https://www.preteckt.com/">Preteckt</a> has had a decent year. The team has grown, customers are starting to see value in what’s an otherwise new-to-the-world product, and there’s plenty of work to do. Like any startup, we are not without our ups and (significant) downs, but the past couple of years has been good for the company, and I’m branching out into some new skills.</p>
<p>While I’ve now worked remotely for 10+ years, it’s good to be part of a distributed company that allows you to make an impact across the world.</p>
<p>This next year should be interesting.</p>
<h2>Tech901</h2>
<p>I continue to be privileged to tech the <a href="https://www.tech901.org/">Code class at Tech901</a>. The pandemic quickly threw a wrench into our in-person classes, but we quickly moved online and then into a hybrid setup shortly thereafter. Teaching online is difficult, not because the tech doesn’t exist to facilitate it, but because it’s so much harder to build a relationship with students. That said, I’ve continued to see students embrace the challenges of this class, acquire some new skills, and go on to make a huge difference in their lives — with a career change. That alone is rewarding enough to keep coming back for more.</p>
<h2>Family.</h2>
<p>Despite all of us being sick over the holidays (Omicron Covid maybe? — going on day 5 of waiting for a PCR test but that’s another story --&gt; **Update**: PCR said no, all the symptoms said yes), we’ve all managed pretty well. I work remotely, the kids have both done online school (and the oldest started college online this year) and my wife’s teaching remotely as well (for now).</p>
<h2>Personally</h2>
<p>As I write this, still feeling — blergh from being sick over the holidays, I can’t help but look forward to a 2022 full of bike rides. The majority of my personal goals for the year revolve around bike rides — from backpacking trips to crit races, I’m ready to roll.</p>
<p>In 2021 I finally got a full year of racing in with the MB team -- That included 11 crits, *at least* 5 gravel races, 5 road races, and a couple of TT's on a road bike. It felt good to race with a team and be a small part in a few successful events. Highlight events of the year included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://my.raceresult.com/184818/results">Chinkapin hollow</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.birminghamhammerfest.com/">Birmingham Hammerfest</a></li>
<li><a href="https://buildpeakcompete.com/tennessee-state-criterium-championship/">Tiger lane</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Bikes keep me healthy &amp; happy, and I’m looking forward to lots of rides in 2022.</p>
