<p>The year is 2213.</p>
<p>The US has extended the term for patents from 20 to 100 years, and passed legislation granting greater powers to patent holders. Additionally, the richest nations of the world have organized the The World Patent Protection Agency (or WPPA).</p>
<p>The WPPA consists of a judicial committee that has far-reaching powers to protect patents across national borders. This is accomplished through the levying of hefty fines and possible embargoes for nations that do not comply with their directives.</p>
<p>Everything else is basically the same as it is today.</p>
