<p>If you have a site where users have the traditional
<em>username</em>/<em>password</em> combination, you've got to provide some
way to let users <strong>change</strong> their password. Luckily, this is
fairly easy to do with Django. The <code>auth</code> app comes with a
<a href="http://goo.gl/sMDqI">password_change</a> view that does what you'd
probably expect.</p>
<p>It's also fairly easy to set up. You add a line similar to the following
to your root URLConf:</p>
<pre><code>url(r'^accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
</code></pre>
<p>You also have to set up some additional templates (e.g. <code>registration/password_change_form.html</code>),
but once you've done that, users can change their password using a form that
looks something like this:</p>
<p>Old password:</p>
<p>New password:</p>
<p>New password confirmation:</p>
<p>Easy! Until...</p>
<h2>What if I can't remember my old password?</h2>
<p>Or worse, yet, what if your users don't have a usable password? If you're
using something like the excellent <a href="http://django-social-auth.readthedocs.org/">django-social-auth</a>, which lets users log in using OAuth or OpenID (i.e. via
Facebook, Twitter, Google, or some other source) you may run into this case.</p>
<p>So, how can I omit the <em>Old Password</em> requirement in the change
password form? We're in luck. The <code>password_change</code> view accepts a
<code>password_change_form</code> parameter that allows you to specify what form
is used. The <code>auth</code> app also contains a form that doesn't require
entering the Old password (it's used in the admin app!). It's called,
<code>AdminPasswordChangeForm</code>. So, all we have to do is update our
root URLConf yet again:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.forms import AdminPasswordChangeForm

ulrpatterns = patterns('', 
    
    # ...
    
    url(r'^accounts/password_change/$',  # hijack password_change's url
        'django.contrib.auth.views.password_change',
        {'password_change_form': AdminPasswordChangeForm},
        name=&quot;password_change&quot;),
    url(r'^accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that the <a href="http://goo.gl/A2pLz">url function</a> allows you
to specify keword parameters for views, and that's exactly what we've done with
this: <code>{'password_change_form': AdminPasswordChangeForm}</code>. That
customizes the form that gets used in the <code>password_change</code> view.</p>
<p>Now, when our users try to change their password, the form looks something
like this:</p>
<p>New password:</p>
<p>New password confirmation:</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This <em>does</em> remove one additional step that a potential
attacker would need to overcome in order to steal an account. So, make sure you
understand why you'd implement this before you do so.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
