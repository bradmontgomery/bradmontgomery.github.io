<p>I make a decent effort to keep up with what's happening in the Python
comunity, but—<em>gosh darnit</em>—it's hard! I think that's why
conferences exist. They give you a day or two to focus solely on meeting people
and catching up with what's going on in the community.</p>
<p>I particularly like the smaller, regional events like the one I attended this
weekend: <a href="http://www.pyarkansas.org/">PyArkansas</a>. Here's a few
reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cost: Smaller, regional conferences tend to be less expensive (<em>Free in
this case!</em>).</li>
<li>Travel: It's not thousands of miles away, so travelling isn't a huge burden.
<em>I rented a van, and took six of my good friends on a three-hour drive</em>)</li>
<li>Size: I think there were about 150 people there. Not too overwhelming, and
you can still meet a good deal of peple.</li>
</ol>
<h2>So... what did I learn?</h2>
<p>This is a bit of a brain dump (<em>don't worry, it'll be short</em>), so
please forgive the terseness.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you work with <a href="http://djano.me/geodjango">GeoDjango</a>, you
really need to keep up with <a href="https://github.com/adamfast">Adam Fast</a></li>
<li>I'm a big fan of Django, but it's always nice to have
<a href="https://twitter.com/kennethreitz">Kenneth Reitz</a> challenging
us to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/kennethreitz/flasky-goodness">re-think
how we build web apps</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielmgrant">Gabriel Grant</a> talked about
<a href="http://stackio.dotcloud.com/">Stack.io</a> and about building rich
applications with Django using <a href="http://django-rest-framework.org/">Django REST Framework</a> and <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a>.
I'd seem Ember.js in passing, but somehow I'd completely missed (or forgot)
about Django REST Framework.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, I walked in late to
<a href="https://github.com/rubic">Jeff Bauer</a>'s talk on
<a href="http://saltstack.org/">Salt</a>, but I caught just enough to really
whet my appetite. I'm a Chef user, but salt seems to have a much lower
barrier to entry, though I'm not sure it completely solves the same problems</li>
<li>I also bumped into Larry Hastings. I'm not much of a podcast listener but
I'd highly suggest checking out his podcast:
<a href="http://radiofreepython.com/">radio free python</a>. It looks very
well-done, and some quick google searchs seem to indicate his listeners
think so, too. He also hooked me up with a cool sticker. Thanks, Larry!</li>
<li>I also need to shout out to
<a href="https://twitter.com/lyndsysimon">Lyndsy Simon</a>, who created both
the PyArkansas and the <a href="https://workforpie.com/">Work for Pie</a>
decals in the swag bag. Great work! :)</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sure I missed meeting many other awesome people, too. If you've
never been to a regional conference like this, make it a point to go! You won't
be sorry.</p>
<p>Good Times!</p>
