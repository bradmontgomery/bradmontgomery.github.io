<p>In a former life (<em>while a GA in graduate school</em>), I ~~was forced
to~~ had the pleasure to teach elementary and intermediate algebra.
These courses are essentially the algebra curriculum you <em>should</em> learn
during High School in the United States. Unfortunately, many college-bound
students don't master the material, and find themselves in a remedial class during
their college career. That's the class I was teaching.</p>
<p>There are many concepts that are difficult for students to understand, but
one of the most perplexing is the concept of <em>Division by Zero</em>.
Interestingly enough, <em>Multiplication by Zero</em> is relatively easy for
students to master:<code>a × 0 = 0</code></p>
<h2>But what is Division?</h2>
<p>We start out teaching division by disguising it as a multiplication problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>3 × ____ = 12</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Read in english, this is &quot;three times what number is twelve?&quot; Then, somewhere
along the line, we introduce this new notation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>12 / 3 = ____</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english, this is &quot;twelve divided by three is what number?&quot; It can also
be read as &quot;three times what number is twelve?&quot; Hey! this is the same as the
equation above!</p>
<p>So, now we get to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>5 / 0 = ____</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen <em>so many people</em> answer this with &quot;zero&quot; (which is incorrect).
In english, we're asking, &quot;zero times what number is five?&quot;</p>
<p>This is essentially: <code>0 × ____ = 5</code>. This problem makes no
sense. It's analogous to asking &quot;Which part of the turkey makes a spaceship?&quot; (OK,
that's a bad analogy, but Thanksgiving was yesterday, and I like spaceships).</p>
<p>Since any number multiplied by zero is zero, there is no answer to this equation.
Mathematicians say the solution is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_(mathematics)">undefined</a>.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure these kinds of problems are just practical jokes played on us
by the Mathematicians of old.</p>
