<p>About a month ago, I was cleaning out some old computer bins, and I stumbled across an old (2012) MacBook Air. I
started to chunk it in the trash (i mean, figure out how to recylce it responsibly), but I opened the thing up and
remembered just how a nice a form-factor the early Air's were. I mean that keyboard... it's way nicer the what we
have now.</p>
<p>This is my story.</p>
<h2>The hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li>A 2012 MacBook Air, 13&quot;</li>
<li>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3427U CPU @ 1.80GHz. 2 Cores, 2 threads.</li>
<li>RAM: 4Gb  (yikes)</li>
<li>Disk: 128Gb SSD (just over 120Gb are usable)</li>
<li>Battery: It was completely dead. I could boot the computer while it was plugged in, but it would die immediately
if unplugged. Good News! You can buy replacement batteries on Amazon &amp; they're super easy to replace.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The OS</h2>
<p>I decided to install <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, well because I heard it was nice. I put the installation
media on a USB drive and honestly, this was so stupidly easy I don't even remember it. I just followed all the default
recommendations.</p>
<h2>The Takeaway</h2>
<p>I realize I'm using a 12-year-old piece of computing hardware. My expectations aren't exactly high, but this has been
an interesting experiment in trying to revive an old piece of hardware.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>It works!</li>
<li>I have a full-featured command-line environment with lots of tools I know how to use.</li>
<li>gvim is still a nice tool for development (my vim skills are a little rusty, but I'm getting there).</li>
<li>The new battery makes this usable without being plugged in.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>4Gb is just really not enough.</li>
<li>Opening more than 4-5 tabs in firefox is likely to completely lock up the machine.</li>
<li>Trying to run VSCode (Flatpack) locked up the machine.</li>
<li>Running to run the Slack app (Flatpack) locked up the machine.</li>
<li>Turns out this thing actually has a fan and it can run pretty darn fast.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This thing basically feels like an under-powered Chromebook (but with firefox). It's perfectly fine for doing work on
the command line. Gvim works fine on medium-sized projects, but for any sort of heavy web-browsing it just doesn't work.</p>
<p>Even after following a number of steps from
<a href="https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/speed-mint.html">this post on improving Mint's performance</a>, it's still
not a great experience. I'll probably keep this for a while for light personal projects. I don't think I could use
this machine for <em>real work</em>. I need too many browser tabs for that.</p>
