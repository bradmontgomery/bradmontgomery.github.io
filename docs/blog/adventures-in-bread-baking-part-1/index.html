<p>Last weekend I attempted to make Mark Bittman's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/081mrex.html?_r=1&amp;ref=dining">Speedy No-Knead Bread</a>... sort of. Being the adventurous experimenter that I am, I altered the ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups whole-grain flour + 1 cup all purpose flour</li>
<li>2 cups of really warm water (instead of the 1.5 cups)</li>
</ul>
<p>I followed the rest of the recipe perfectly. However, the results were really unsatisfactory. The center was super dense and gooey, and the bread had a really really hard crust (ok, I also cooked it an extra 30 minutes because of the gooey center).</p>
<p><em>I didn't take any pictures, because the results were so embarrassing.</em></p>
<p>Here's what I learned: <strong>Bread Flour != All Purpose Flour</strong> (for the non-programmer, that means they are NOT the same thing!)</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2316531_make-bread-flour.html">several</a> <a href="http://www.nestle.com/NutritionHealthAndWellness/Cooking/AskGilla/CookingTips/Bread+flour.htm">articles</a> online that expound on the <a href="http://www.ochef.com/97.htm">differences between bread flour and all-purpose flour</a>.</p>
<p>The secret is <em>wheat gluten</em> (or <em>gluten additive</em>). Essentially, you must add 1tsp to each cup of all-purpose flour to create bread flour. Unfortunately, this is not something I keep. So part 2 will have to wait until I go shopping...</p>
