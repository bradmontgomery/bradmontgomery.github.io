<p>**Prompt**: Explain how to select a javascript framework in the style of edgar allen poe</p>
<hr />
<p>Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
&quot;’Tis some visitor,&quot; I muttered, &quot;tapping at my chamber door —
Only this and nothing more.&quot;</p>
<p>But the tapping grew louder and more insistent, and I knew that I must attend to the matter at hand. I rose from my seat and opened the door to find a host of JavaScript frameworks, each vying for my attention. Angular, React, Vue, and more, all clamoring to be chosen as the one to bring my project to life.</p>
<p>But how to select just one, from this ghoulish throng? I weighed the pros and cons of each, as if they were spirits from the land of the dead. Angular, with its powerful structure and robust feature set, seemed like a force to be reckoned with. But then there was React, with its virtual DOM and ease of use, that seemed like a gentle guide through the dark and treacherous landscape of web development. And Vue, with its simplicity and flexibility, that seemed like a beacon of hope in a sea of confusion.</p>
<p>And so, I chose, as one does in matters of the heart, with a sense of intuition. I selected the framework that seemed to speak to me, that seemed to call to me from the abyss. And with that, I closed the door on the other frameworks, banishing them from my thoughts forevermore.</p>
<p>Thus, I selected my framework, with a sense of mystery, and a touch of the macabre. For in the end, the choice of a JavaScript framework is not a decision to be made lightly, but one to be made with the utmost care and attention, as if choosing a companion for a journey into the unknown.</p>
