<p>I started using mercurial around version 1.2, and I'm pretty sure I used the Mac OS X installer (from <a href="http://mercurial.berkwood.com/">http://mercurial.berkwood.com/</a>) to install 1.2.1. This placed hg in /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/.</p>
<p>Now, I've decided to upgrade to 1.3.1, and I again grab the Mac OS X installer (again from <a href="http://mercurial.berkwood.com/">http://mercurial.berkwood.com/</a>), which installs hg in /usr/local/bin/.</p>
<p>Ok, but my path is set up so that the older version is used by default... Is there a preferred way to remove the older version of mercurial?</p>
<p>I just renamed the file: /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/hg to hg-1.2.1, and source'd my .profile so that the new version (/usr/local/bin/hg) gets used instead.</p>
<p>This does not seem like a good way to upgrade. :(</p>
