<p>So, you've got a shiny new Django-powered site, and now you'd like to start
recording metrics. Perhaps you've read <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The
Lean Startup</a>, and you know you've got to know how people are using your
site in order to know what to improve. Perhaps you're just a data nerd and you
like to count things. Either way, there are ton's of ways to measure things
on your site.</p>
<p>You could use third-party applications like <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> or <a href="https://mixpanel.com/">Mixpanel</a> to see how
people interact with your site. Then there are services like <a href="https://newrelic.com/">New Relic</a> that give you amazing insights as to where your application is slow
or too memory hungry. All of these services are really good, and if you're building
a startup, you should be using them.</p>
<p>But sometimes, you need a little more flexibility when <em>counting things</em>.
That's the motivation behind <a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-redis-metrics"><code>django-redis-metrics</code></a>. It's a simple, lightweight Django app that
lets you easily record metrics in your Django apps.</p>
<p>I use it on <a href="https://workforpie.com">Work for Pie</a> to measure
things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>User growth</li>
<li>External API usage (e.g. how hard we're hitting the GitHub or StackOverflow APIs)</li>
<li>User interaction (e.g. how frequently somone
<a href="https://workforpie.com/companies/gallery/">follows a company</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once installed, it's fairly simple to start recording metrics. You can call
out to the <code>metric</code> function anywhere in your code, and that will
increment a counter every time the function is called.</p>
<pre><code>from redis_metrics import metric

metric(&quot;thing-i-want-to-measure&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>All data is stored in <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> (which is a great
data store for this kind of thing). and there are very
few dependencies. <code>django-redis-metrics</code> aims to be a fairly
minimalistic, and very simple to use out of the box.</p>
<p>If you need a simple way to measure arbitrary events in a Django app, please
give it a look.</p>
