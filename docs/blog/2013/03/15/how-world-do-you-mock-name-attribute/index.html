<p><strong>Or...</strong>  My adventures with Mock. Part 1.</p>
<p>I've been working a lot with
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/">Mock</a>
lately (and by <em>lately</em>, I meand for the last three months). Though it
takes a while to wrap your head around it, it's an amazing and powerful testing
tool.</p>
<p>To get started, let's look at some of the neat things you can do with Mock.
Take this class, for example:</p>
<pre><code>class Thing(object):
    shape = 'square'
    color = 'blue'

    def calculate(self):
        # ... do some stuff ...

</code></pre>
<p>If you were writing a test, and you wanted a Mocked <code>Thing</code>, but
still wanted to ensure that your mock object had <code>shape</code> and
<code>color</code> attributes, you'd do the following:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing = Mock(shape='square', color='blue')
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.shape
'square'
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.color
'blue'
</code></pre>
<p>Cool! You get attributes whose values you can test against, and you still
have a mock object on which you can call methods:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock
&gt;&gt;&gt; thing.calculate()  # pretend this calculates something
&lt;Mock name='mock.calculate()' id='4338034768'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I think Mock really shines when you're working with code that hits external
APIs (I do this a <em>lot</em> with
<a href="https://workforpie.com">Work for Pie</a>). Imagine for a minute that
the <code>Thing.calculate()</code> sent some data up to an external API, then
used the results to calculate and return a value. With a Mocked object, your
tests can run without hitting the api. This is a Good Thing! In order to write
that test, you'd do somethign like this</p>
<pre><code>from mock import calls

def test_calculate():
    thing = Mock(shape='square', color='blue')
    thing.calculate()
    thing.assert_has_calls([call.calculate()])
</code></pre>
<h2>So what was that thing about <code>name</code> attributes?</h2>
<p>Now here's where things get tricky. For one reason or another, many of my
API-wrapper classes have a <code>name</code> attribute. The Mock class also
has a keyword argument <code>name</code>, that lets you give the Mock a name
(the <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/mock.html#mock.Mock">docs</a> say this is useful for debugging).</p>
<p>So, how in the world am I supposed to write a Mock for something like this,
and still be able to specify the value of an attribute?</p>
<pre><code>class SomeAPIWrapper(object):
    name = 'brad'
    token = 'secret'
</code></pre>
<p>Well, this <strong>does not work</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; api = Mock(name='brad', token='secret')
&gt;&gt;&gt; api.token  # Ok, this looks fine.
'secret'
&gt;&gt;&gt; api.name  # not what I want
&lt;Mock name='important-thing-here.name' id='4337316944'&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Luckily, there's this neat class called a
<a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/mock.html#mock.PropertyMock">PropertyMock</a>. It took me a bit to figure out how to use it, but it's
essentially used as a property or an attribute on another class (including
another mock). I honestly don't know if this is <em>supposed to work this
way</em> or if this is a nasty hack (feel free to <a href="/contact/">let me
know</a> one way or another), but this is how I attached a <code>name</code>
attribute to a Mock object:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from mock import Mock, PropertyMock
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a Mock for my ``SomeAPIWrapper`` class above
&gt;&gt;&gt; api = Mock(token='secret')
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Create a PropertyMock representing the ``name`` attribute
&gt;&gt;&gt; p = PropertyMock(return_value='brad')
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Replace Mock's name with our new property
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(api).name = p
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Now see what happens
&gt;&gt;&gt; api.token
'secret'
&gt;&gt;&gt; api.name
'brad'
</code></pre>
<p>Now, your Mock objects can have a name attribute with an expected return
value.</p>
