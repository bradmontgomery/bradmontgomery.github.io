<p>Today I ran out of disk space on my Macbook Air. I mean, <em>completely</em> out of
space. I use vagrant and
Virtualbox for work, and I knew that had
several large, but older snapshots of virtual machines that I could remove to
free up space.</p>
<p>And that's how today fell apart.</p>
<p>I also use the vagrant-vbox-snapshot
plugin, and that's the tool I typically use to take snapshots when I need them.</p>
<p>So, looking into my project folder, I run the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant snapshot list

Name: 2013-11-05 (UUID: ... )
Name: 2014-01-26 (UUID: ... )
Name: 2014-02-07 (UUID: ... )
Name: 2014-02-22 (UUID: ... )
</code></pre>
<p>I tend to name my snapshots after the date on which I take them. Each of these
is around 8Gb in size, so I decide to delete the oldest one.</p>
<pre><code>$ vagrant snapshot delete 2013-11-05
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, whenever you remove a snapshot, VirtualBox decides to write some
data to disk. Think about that for a second.</p>
<p><em>You can't remove a snapshot if your disk is full!</em></p>
<p>This command attempted to remove a snapshot, then after a minute failed with
a scary message (which I forgot to copy, and have since lost). And because the
VM is hosed, vagrant will offer the following complaint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your VM has become &quot;inaccessible.&quot; Unfortunately, this is a critical error
with VirtualBox that Vagrant can not cleanly recover from. Please open
VirtualBox and clear out your inaccessible virtual machines or find a way
to fix them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you run vagrant status, you'll see something like this</p>
<pre><code>Current machine states:

my\_vm inaccessible (virtualbox)
</code></pre>
<p>So, I did what Vagrant told me, and opened up VirtualBox. Well, the GUI tools
listed <em>my_vm</em>, but also had a label next to it that said, <em>inaccessible</em>, and
as far as I could, there were no enabled options that would let me do anything.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I was ready to freak out a little.</p>
<p>All is not lost, however. You see, there's a directoy where VirtualBox stores
it's machine images and it's config data. For me, that's in ~/VirtualBox VMs/.</p>
<p>Inside that directory, vagrant should create a directory for each of it's
vms. So, I had some data at ~/VirtualBox VMs/someproject_myvm_1234567890.
The contents fo this folder look something like:</p>
<pre><code> .
 ├── Logs/
 ├── Snapshots/
 ├── box-disk1.vmdk
 ├── myproject\_myvm\_1234567890.vbox
 └── myproject\_myvm\_1234567890.vbox-pre
</code></pre>
<p>That file with the .vbox-pre is an automatically generated backup of the
VirtualBox config file, prior to it saving a VM. So, here's what I did:</p>
<p>Replace the .vbox config with the .vbox-pre config:</p>
<pre><code>cat myproject\_myvm\_1234567890.vbox-pre &gt; myproject\_myvm\_1234567890.vbox
</code></pre>
<p>After that, my both VirtualBox and vagrant appeared to work with my VMs.</p>
<p>Crisis averted, and with only a couple hours lost.</p>
