<p>I'm not a physicist, but I've got some views on <em>string theory</em>
that I'd like to share. Here goes:</p>
<p>Brad's String Theory: Axiom I
While in motion, strings will become untied, regardless of advanced
techniques employed to fasten them.
Brad's String Theory: Axiom II
When at rest (i.e. upon completion of aforementioned motion), strings
will be resistant to any attempt at unfastening.</p>
<p>These statements are, to best of my knowledge, universally true, based on
my experiences during daily runs for the past few years.</p>
