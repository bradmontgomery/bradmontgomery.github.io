<p>I use Django with Apache and mod_wsgi. Each project that I work on has different apache config files, so I like to keep those in the same mercurial repo that contains my django project's code.</p>
<p>For some time now, it's been bugging me that vim doesn't do syntax highlighting for those apache configs (nor the wsgi files). I finally decided to do something about it, and I'm glad I did, because it's a fairly simple fix:</p>
<p>My project directory layout often look like this:</p>
<pre><code>  
~/django_projects/projectname/  
    __init__.py  
    apache_configs/  
        projectname  
        projectname.wsgi  
    manage.py  
    settings.py  
    myapp/  

</code></pre>
<p>Vim does syntax highlighting for apache files based on their path. To get vim to recognize the files in the <em>apache_configs</em> directory, you need to edit (or create) <em>~/.vim/filetype.vim</em> and add the following:</p>
<pre><code>  
au BufNewFile,BufRead ~/django_projects/de_concierge/apache_configs/*wsgi setf python  
au BufNewFile,BufRead ~/django_projects/de_concierge/apache_configs/* setf apache   

</code></pre>
<p>You'd have to add variants of this for each separate project, but this works well for me.</p>
<p>There's several other ways you can modify this, and the solution that I used comes from <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/vim_mac/browse_thread/thread/26c3a097e6e69c5f">this thread on the vim_mac mailing list</a>. (There's also a lot of good info in <em>:help new-filetype</em> ).<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-5589084931666424010?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
