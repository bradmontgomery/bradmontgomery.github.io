<p>UPDATE: Thanks in advance to the comments from <a href="http://blog.dscpl.com.au/">Graham Dumpleton</a> whose comments below pointed me in the right direction!</p>
<p>This was~~is~~ a plea for help.</p>
<p>I've got django installed and configured with apache and virtualenv. I also have one particular app (named <strong>myapp</strong>) that queries an Oracle database directly (django is configured to use MySQL). All of the apps work, <strong>except</strong> for anything thatbrequires the <strong>myapp</strong> app... which includes the admin!</p>
<p>Requesting any view that uses cx_Oracle results in a cryptic error simiar to:</p>
<p><strong>ViewDoesNotExist at /some/url/</strong><br />
<em>Could not import myproject.myapp.views. Error was: libclntsh.so.10.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</em></p>
<p>The full traceback follows:</p>

<p>The strange thing is that tests using cx_Oracle run correctly (as does code typed into the interpreter via ./manage.py shell), so cx_Oracle is installed correctly in the virtualenv. Orignally, I thought that apache was somehow misconfigured. The problem, however, is that Apache just doesn't know where to find the shared libraries for cx_Oracle's C extension modules. On my system (Ubuntu), shared libraries are located in /usr/lib and /usr/local/lib .</p>
<p>When building cx_Oracle, you must include an environment variable for ORACLE_HOME and update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that it also includes ORACLE_HOME. While logged in as the <em>django</em> user, I updated .bashrc so that it includes the following:</p>
<pre><code>export ORACLE\_HOME=/home/django/oracle/instantclient_10_2  
export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=$ORACLE\_HOME:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH  

</code></pre>
<p>For me, all of the cx_Oracle shared libraries are located in <strong>/home/django/oracle/instantclient_10_2</strong>. So, (with my virtualenv activated) I built, installed, and tested cx_Oracle, and everything worked fine, because my user environment was set up so that these shared libraries are available.</p>
<p>To make these available to Apache, I created <strong>hard</strong> links to all of the shared libraries from /usr/local/lib, and then ran ldconfig. Note that ldconfig ignores symbolic links!</p>
<pre><code>cd /usr/local/lib  
sudo ln /home/django/oracle/instantclient_10_2/libclntsh.so.10.1  
# also creating links to all other libs  
sudo ldconfig  

</code></pre>
<p>After restarting Apache, my django apps worked as expected. For the curious, my wsgi script and apache config follows.</p>
<p><strong>My .wsgi script</strong></p>
<pre><code>import sys  
import site  
import os  
  
vepath = '/home/django/.virtualenvs/myproject/lib/python2.6/site-packages'  
prev_sys_path = list(sys.path)  
  
# add the site-packages of our virtualenv as a site dir  
site.addsitedir(vepath)  
  
# add the app's directory to the PYTHONPATH  
sys.path.append('/home/django/django\_projects/myproject\_root/myproject/')  
sys.path.append('/home/django/django\_projects/myproject\_root/')  
os.environ['PYTHON\_EGG\_CACHE'] = '/home/django/.python-eggs'  
  
new_sys_path = [p for p in sys.path if p not in prev_sys_path]  
for item in new_sys_path:   
    sys.path.remove(item)  
sys.path[:0] = new_sys_path  
  
from django.core.handlers.wsgi import WSGIHandler  
os.environ['DJANGO\_SETTINGS\_MODULE'] = 'myproject.settings'  
application = WSGIHandler()  

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Pertinent part of the Apache Config, located within a VirtualHost Directive:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Alias /media/ /var/www/media/  
Alias /site\_media/ /var/www/static/  
  
# Run WSGI in Daemon Mode:  
WSGIDaemonProcess myproject user=www-data group=www-data threads=25  
WSGIProcessGroup myproject  
WSGIScriptAlias / /home/django/django\_projects/myproject\_root/apache\_mod\_wsgi\_conf/myproject.wsgi  

</code></pre>
<p>NOTE: Graham Dumpleton suggests four options to get around the original problem (and I paraphrase):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Rebuild cx_Oracle setting the LD_RUN_PATH</em> - I tried this, but was unnsuccessful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Put the shared libraries in /usr/lib</em> - I hard linked to the libraries from /usr/local/lib. This is the solution that worked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Modify /etc/ld.conf so that it includes the path to the shared libraries</em> - I considered adding a file to /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ which would have included the path to my ORACLE_HOME directory. However, the above options worked, so I went with that instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Edit /etc/apache/envvars so that it includes the appropriate environment variables</em> - I also tried this approach, including the same environment variables that I added to my .bashrc, but this also did not work</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps someone else!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6881096023935249692?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
