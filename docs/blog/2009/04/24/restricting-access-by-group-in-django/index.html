<p>Django's <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/auth/">authentication</a>
system provides built-in support for Groups. When developing an app, you may
want to prevent users in a particular group from accessing part of your app.</p>
<p>For example, if you were building a tool to be used by <em>Faculty</em>
and <em>Students</em>, it's quite possible that there would be parts of the
app you wouldn't want <em>Students</em> to access (like the part that allows a
User to change grades!). Luckily, there's a decorator called
<em><a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/auth/#limiting-access-to-logged-in-users-that-pass-a-test">user_passes_test</a></em>
that allows you to easily perform this sort of thing. Let's see an example:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required, user_passes_test  
  
@login\_required  
@user\_passes\_test(lambda u: u.groups.filter(name='Student').count() == 0, login_url='/myapp/denied/')  
def some\_view(request):  
  
    # Do whatever this view should do  

</code></pre>
<p>The view above (which lacks any content) actually uses two decorators.
The first <em>login_required</em> simply requires that a user be logged in.
The second, <em>user_passes_test</em>, requires a function as the first argument.
This function must accept a User object and return True or False.
If True, the User can view the page. If False, the user cannot view the page.</p>
<p>We define this function using a python
<a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/expressions.html#lambdas">Lambda Expression</a>.
It simply uses the ORM to check if a User is in the <em>Student</em> group.
In this example, <strong>u</strong> would be an instance of django.contrib.auth.models.User.</p>
<pre><code>lambda u: u.groups.filter(name='Student').count() == 0  

</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you can specify the keyword argument <em>login_url</em> to the
<em>user_passes_test</em> decorator. Normally, if the user failed the test this
would redirect them to a login page. However, in our case, they're already
logged in (because of the <em>login_required</em> decorator), so this just acts
as a redirect page. In this example, it would redirect to a url that we've
specified which might contain an Access Denied message (<em>with giant red
blinking letters</em>!)</p>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<p>UPDATE: There is one slight caveat to this solution so far... it breaks if
your user is not already logged in. In fact, this will result in</p>
<p><strong>AttributeError</strong>:<code>'NoneType' object has no attribute '_meta'</code></p>
<p>So, to account for that, we need to put the logic that tests for
Student-group membership into its own function. The result would look
something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>def not\_in\_student\_group(user):  
    if user:  
        return user.groups.filter(name='Student').count() == 0  
    return False
</code></pre>
<p>This makes sure the user object exists before trying the test, and if not,
we assume the test fails (by returning False). Now, our decorator will look
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>@login\_required  
@user\_passes\_test(not_in_student_group, login_url='/advising/denied/')  
def some\_view(request):  
    # ...  

</code></pre>
