<p>Early in January I saw a backlash towards things like whole30, paleo, and keto in some of my fitness circles. I'm not sure why, but I do think a lot people approach these things as &quot;quick fixes&quot; rather than tools for setting a sustainable, healthy lifestyle. Admittedly, I've done the Whole30 regimen twice (2015, 2016), so I *should* have all the tools I need to have a healthy food lifestyle. But sometimes, things go off the rails.</p>
<p>It turns out that 2018 was a tough year for many reason. That has resulted in me being chronically stressed and very likely chronically inflamed. My old neck pain has returned and I've also got persistent wrist pain again; both of which disappeared during my first Whole30. It turns out I'm also a stress eater, and a solid supply of sweets has been shoveled into my mouth over the last six months (at least)! All that and a recent trip to the doctor's office that shows some of my vitals are in the dangerous levels... well, I need a little hand-holding to get myself back on track.</p>
<p>So, I'm doing a Whole30. I'm actually on day 8, and things are going ok. I'm re-reading _It Starts with Food_, because I like the sciency stuff, and I've started following <a href="https://robbwolf.com/">Robb Wolf</a> on YouTube to to try to catch up with how this stuff has changed in the last ten years.</p>
<p>The last time I did whole30, I was really active on social media, and I posted everything on instagram. I'm less active these days, but I'll still share a food pic now &amp; then. If you're interested, you can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bkmontgomery/">follow me on instagram</a> or check out <a href="https://whatsbradeating.tumblr.com/">whatsbradeating.tumblr.com</a> assuming tumblr doesn't disappear anytime soon.</p>
<p>Here's to a healthier, fitter Brad in 2019.</p>
