<h2>New Website?</h2>
<p>I've been meaning to shift my personal site to a static site for quite a while. I fully indented to use something like
<a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> or even <a href="https://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> which I formerly used to manage the
<a href="https://mempy.org">mempy.org</a> website. Earlier this year, I archived my
<a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/django-blargg">django-blargg</a> repo, and so with a little extra time around the
holidays I decided to finally make this happen.</p>
<p>I really wanted to use Hugo. I've used it before, it's got a great feature-set and tons of support. BUT! I had a few
requirements for my new site:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URIs don't change</a>. I really really though I could do this with hugo,
and I 100% beleive it's possible, but I just pounded my head against this forever. Eventually I ditched hugo because
of this requirement (and the fact that I had some markdown + some rst + some html content).</li>
<li>I really want to just use markdown. Most of my content was already there, and with a little extra throw-away code I
mostly converted everythign to markdown.</li>
<li>I really don't want to think too hard. I write so infrequently hugo's giant feature-set was just a bit much.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>I know python. I know jinja. I know how I want to organize my content.</em></p>
<h2>New Wheel.</h2>
<p><strong>Well crap</strong>. <a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/bradmontgomery.github.io/pull/1">I've reinvented a static site generator</a>.
Right now, the feature set is pretty small (just want I wanted). Features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two commands for managing content:
<ul>
<li><code>python site.py new</code> to generate a template for new articles</li>
<li><code>python site.py build</code> to build the site.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>support for <a href="https://commonmark.org/">CommonMark</a> thanks to <a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/markdown-it-py">markdown-it-py</a></li>
<li>Easy (for me) template customization thanks to <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/">jinja</a></li>
<li>A very simple UI -- because I didn't want to think about this righ now, but it'll probably change. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/kevquirk/simple.css">kevquirk/simple.css</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested, take a look at the single python module here: <a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/bradmontgomery.github.io/blob/main/site.py">https://github.com/bradmontgomery/bradmontgomery.github.io/blob/main/site.py</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't really indented to be shipped, but if there's interest I could turn it into a library. I probably should. Maybe. We'll see.</p>
