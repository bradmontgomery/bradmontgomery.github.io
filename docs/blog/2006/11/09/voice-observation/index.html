<p>Apparently, I haven't quite beat the flu... or whatever it is that's making me cough. So head over to my local Medical Practitioner and get a nice pharmaceutical conglomeration injected into my hip. Apparently, I could also use some antibiotics, too... so I head over to walgreens and drop off the magical note that lets them know it's OK to give me drugs. I wait several hours, and then I discover that my insurance has rejected a claim... Uhm, OK. So my first thought is &quot;Did someone pull an <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151804/">Office Space</a> maneuver on me and forget to tell me I don't have a job!&quot;<br />
I hope not.So, I call up my Insurance company to see if there's something wrong, and of course, I get an automated system. However, instead of giving me a menu and letting me push a button, I'm greated by a voice that asks me to <strong>speak</strong> my responses to the menu... (like I'm a dog or something). Some people call this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Voice (or Speech) Recognition</a>. I didn't notice much recognizing though. I guess computers aren't designed to interact with people who cough. Basically the transcript of my conversation with the menu went like this:</p>
<p>Menu: Do you need information about Health or Dental insurance?<br />
Me: Health (cough)(cough)<br />
Menu: I'm sorry, please say Health or Dental<br />
Me: Health (I then turn my head away from the phone and cough)<br />
Menu: Please say Health or Dental<br />
Me: HEALTH<br />
Menu: Did you say &quot;Start Over?&quot;<br />
Me: Ahhh!</p>
<p>Menu: Welcome to... *click*</p>
<p>Yeah, I hung up the phone. Well... actually I just hit 0, which normally bypasses the automated system and sends you right to an operator. Unfortunately, their offices were closed. I guess I'll just call tomorrow and try to see why my insurance was cancelled.</p>
