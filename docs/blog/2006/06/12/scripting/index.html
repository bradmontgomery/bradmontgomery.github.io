<p>I imagine that anybody who actually likes programming is familiar with the many popular scripting languages in use today. Of course, a lot of web devs and sysadmins have been using languages like <a href="http://php.net">php</a>, <a href="http://perl.com">perl</a>, and <a href="http://python.org">python</a> for ages, but if you read any tech news (like <a href="http://slashdot.org">/.</a>), you'll know that the newest craze is <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">ruby</a>. I've played with it a little, and I can actually see what the hype is all about... It's a neat language, and it <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=links&amp;tags=ruby">has a lot to offer</a>.Though, as much as I've been wanting to really get my hands dirtly with ruby, I've recently been involved with a project that is heavily dependent on <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=links&amp;tags=tcl">tcl</a>, and I have to admit... I'm beginning to really like it. Oh, it's syntax takes a little getting used to, but I think it's the simplicity of the language itself that I like. If you've been using any of the above languages, I'm fairly sure that you might have worked for a few days (or weeks) to get really comfortable, but it just seems like tcl is small enough to wrap your brain around in about a day, and be fairly productive... Now, I haven't gotten into tk, but I'm sure I'll be looking into that soon. Of course, take this for what it's worth.I've always liked <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=awk">awk</a>.<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-8826573165498854870?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
