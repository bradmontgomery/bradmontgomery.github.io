<p>This may come as a surprise, but I actually got into computer science thinking I would eventually find a job making computer games! What's more surprising, though, is that I've never even tried to write a game of any sort! There are plenty of places to start, I mean, there's only <a href="http://sourceforge.net/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=80">11,000 game projecs</a> on <a href="http://sourceforge.net">Sourceforge</a>. Now, I'm guessing that about half of those are actually Libraries or Frameworks for developing games, and sometimes I wonder if maybe that's part of the problem... There's just so much to choose from, how do you pick one? Or should you just pick something like <a href="http://www.libsdl.org">SDL</a> and see how far you can get with that before you need something else? And then what? Suppose you build a nice game (and is this even possible for a 1-2 person team)... Do you try to build a business and grab a piece of the billion-dollar entertainment industry? I wonder if the games like <a href="http://www.vendetta-online.com/">Vendetta Online</a> produce any profits. Maybe it's time I start a company!Oh, and send a <a href="http://rosemarie.name">Happy Birthday wish to my sweetheart.</a>!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-4482087934884248919?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
