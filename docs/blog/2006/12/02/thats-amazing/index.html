<p>'Tiz the season... so today I went to Wal-Mart to get a <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=3162815">Pre-Lit Christmas Tree</a>. I'm still a little amazed at how easy this thing was to assemble when compared to a real tree of the same size. Sure it doesn't smell like a real tree, but I don't have to worry about watering it so that it doesn't become a fire hazard. Besides, <a href="http://thegirls.bradmontgomery.net/">the girls</a> really liked it, and that's all that counts! In fact, Dakota (3yrs) walked into the den, looked at the tree, and just said &quot;That's Amazing&quot;. Where does she learn these things!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-349748731139717256?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
