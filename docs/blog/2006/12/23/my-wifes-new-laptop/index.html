<p>Well, the semester has ended, so I've been working from home (trying to catch up on all of the &quot;extra work&quot;, and, while out to the gym, <a href="http://rosemarie.name">My wife</a> gives me a call and starts asking about laptop specs!? It turns out she's got her eye on a nice little bundle at <a href="http://www.radioshack.com">Radio Shack</a>!</p>
<p>It seems they had an <a href="http://hp.com">HP Pavilion dv2000 notebook</a> (Turion 64 - 2Ghz/512Mb Ram/100Gb HD/nvidia Geforce go 6150) with a bundled 6.0 megapixel digital camera, and a printer/scanner/copier for less than $1000! So, she makes a purchase, and the notebook is a surprisingly nice little machine. It's a little lacking on Memory, but luckily, it seems <a href="http://newegg.com">NewEgg</a> has just what we need to fix that. I'm particularly impressed with the graphics capabilities of this machine (which are usually lacking in notebooks).</p>
<p>So, while looking around for something to test its capabilities, I ran across the <a href="http://www.warrock.net/">War Rock</a> demo. I thought I'd just try it out, and it plays quite nicely. Hopefully, a memory upgrade will provide even greater performance, though. Perhaps one of the best features of this notebook is its display - a widescreen 14 inch, which runs at 1280x800 by default. Despite the relatively small size, it offers a very nice view for a laptop computer. Overall, I'm quite proud of my wife's purchase, and I've probably used it more than she has!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6359139082435247171?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
