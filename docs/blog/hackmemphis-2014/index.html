<p>The second annual HACKmemphis happened (is still
happening, actually) this weekend, and it's been a blast. I went into the event
with lots of ideas, but with very few expectations for myself.</p>
<p>My Goals: Hang out with friends (new &amp; old) and have fun.</p>
<p><strong>Mission Accomplished!</strong></p>
<p>I did build some stuff, too, so I feel pretty good about that. The stuff includes
a simple, fun little app, improvements to an Alfred Workflow, and some
improvements to Elvis, our community hubot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Announcing, Echyo. This was a
completely unplanned project, and was inspired by some conversations had on
Friday night. If you're one of a select lucky few, this app with send you a
Yo message when you @-reply to me on twitter.
Amazing, right.</li>
<li>I've got an Alfred workflow (that is now mis-named)
<em>percent change</em>. You can get it from Packal, but it
lets you do percentage calculations easily. I added a few features this weekend
and cleared up some bits that were confusing.</li>
<li>Our local irc channel (<code>#memtech</code> on freenode) has a
hubot instanced named Elvis (what else!). I finally got a chance to (a) Fix a bug in a
script that pulls from What's Brad Eating, and (b) modify our meetup script so that it'll
just list the next upcoming tech event.</li>
</ol>
<p>Long live: elvis meetup.</p>
<p><em>Huge thanks</em> go out to all of the people that made this weekend possible,
especially the sponsors and to Cowork Memphis for hosting.
There was a ton of work that went into this, and I'm incredibly proud to be a
part of the Memphis Tech community.</p>
<p>The awesomeness isn't over yet, so watch along on twitter by following <code>#HACKmemphis</code> and <code>#memtech</code>.</p>
