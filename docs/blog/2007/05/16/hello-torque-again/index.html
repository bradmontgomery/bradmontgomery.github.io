<p>Well, I've just begun to dig into the <a href="http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque/tge/">Torque Game Engine</a> again, but this time, I'm building it on a Linux box. Once I downloaded the Linux source, it took me a while to figure out how to get it compiled. TGE's configuration is a little different than the typical &quot;./configure and make&quot; process.</p>
<p>First of all, I tried to make sure I had all of the development tools necessary to build TGE, including <strong>nasm</strong>, <strong>libogg</strong>, <strong>libvorbis</strong>, and <strong>libtheora</strong> along with any -dev versions of many packages. Then, once you unzip the source you need to issue the following command to set up your configuration:</p>
<pre><code>make -f mk/configure.mk
</code></pre>
<p>This will display the current build configuration and it will tell you if it's valid or not. To get a valid configuration on my system, I used the following configuration:</p>
<pre><code>make -f m/configure.mk OS=LINUX COMPILER=GCC4 BUILD=DEBUG \  
DIR.OBJ=/home/brad/TorqueGameEngineSDK-Linux-1-5-0/build
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that I had to use an absolute path for the (optional) object Directory. At first, I just used &quot;DIR.OBJ=build&quot;, which resulted in some compiler errors. Anyway, this placed all the object files in a directory called &quot;build.GCC4.DEBUG&quot;</p>
<p>The next change I had to make was in an actual source file. Apparently, GCC didn't like some things... I'm not going to post any details, but I did eventually get it working, so <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=contact">contact me</a> if you're interested.</p>
<p>Good Luck!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-6044072354529285854?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
