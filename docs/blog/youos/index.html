<p>Occasionally, I run across some project that's implementing an idea that I've had ... That's the case with <a href="https://www.youos.com/">YouOS</a>. I think I even wrote a paper about it in 1998, but that's what happens when your lazy (read: too many other things you have to do!)</p>
<p>I created an account, and though it was a little slow for my wife's laptop, YouOS is really a very impressive project. Now, all the world needs is a very small OS that runs on every hardware platform (for connectivity/etc), and a very fast standards-compliant browser that runs on top of that (maybe the guys at <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">dillo</a> should reevaluate their roadmap); AND NOTHING ELSE!</p>
<p>You know, I just had one other thought: Maybe this is the GUI necessary for widespread use of <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/plan9/">Plan9</a>.</p>
