<p>Well, I've finally grabbed a copy of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">IE7 beta</a>, and I have to admit that I'm impressed... although, I recognize features that are present in almost<br />
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">every</a> <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">other</a> <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/">browser</a> <a href="http://www.opera.com/">I've</a> used. So far, I'm pleased to see that IE7 doesn't break too many of the sites that I've built, which make extensive use of CSS. I guess this just goes to show that competition DOES foster innovation.</p>
<p>With IE7, I've also got my first look at <a href="http://www.live.com/">Windows Live</a>, which of course competes with <a href="http://google.com">Google</a>. One of the first things I noted about this site is the background image on the banner at the top of the page. I don't know if anyone else has pointed this out or not, but it has a striking resemblance to the default Mac OS X background (<a href="http://store.apple.com">look around here</a>). Though I'm a relatively new Mac user, it seems like I'm seeing more and more things that are &quot;borrowed&quot; from <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a>. Now, I've had a brief look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/">Windows Vista</a>, and I'll admit, there were some things that would seem awfully familiar to any OS X Tiger users... but I'll let someone else make a more extensive comparison.</p>
<p>All in all, I have to commend Microsoft. At least they're paying attention.</p>
