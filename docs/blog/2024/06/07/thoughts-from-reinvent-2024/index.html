<p>I've just gotten home from a week at AWS re:Invent. There were so many new product announcements,
but the overarching theme of the conference was (surprising to no-body) Generative AI.</p>
<p>It was pretty eye-opening to hear stories from across a number of industries about how other
companyies have already started integrating Generative AI into their processes and workflows —
<em>although</em> the most common story told was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Q for for developers.</li>
<li>Amazon Q to do big project upgrades (e.g. Java code)</li>
<li>Amazon Q to help write test cases.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are surprising, really.</p>
<p>And while I feel like I could absolutely see this coming, I've also realized that <em>my own</em> journey into
the world of Genative AI is lagging. But I have <em>some idead</em>! (watch this space)</p>
<p>Personally, the exciting take-aways for me are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon Q &amp; Bedrock are really powerful tools. I want to build something with Bedrock and see how
this all works in practice.</li>
<li>S3 Table buckets and S3 Metadata buckets are going to save a lot of people a lot of work — Table Buckets
provide native support for Apache Iceberg and handle all the maintenance behind the scences and Metadata buckets
give you a reliable place to store metadata so S3 is now (if it wasn't already) the best way to build out a Data
Lake, Lakhouse, wharehouse whatever you want to call it.</li>
<li>I'd somehow missed the memo that AWS was building <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/silicon-innovation/">their own silicon</a>
cloud computing workloads. The <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ai/machine-learning/trainium/">AWS Trainium</a> announcments
just make me realized that's easier than ever to build &amp; train ML models at scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>This was my first time at re:Invent, so I have a ton of thoughts to process, but these are the (technology) highlights.</p>
