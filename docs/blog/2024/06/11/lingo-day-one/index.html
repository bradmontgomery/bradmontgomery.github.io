<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>I <em>installed</em> (attached?) the Lingo CGM last night before going to bed. These are my thoughts for day 1.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>If you've seen ads for any of the CGM's, you've probably seen how easy it is to use one of these things. It comes
with an applicator and the process is basically:</p>
<ol>
<li>unscrew the applicator lid</li>
<li>push the applicator into the monitor</li>
<li>push the applicator + monitor into the back of your arm.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's as easy as that. I felt a slight prick on application, but honestly it wasn't painful at all. I had a weird
sensation on my arm for about two minutes afterward, but that could just be a weird <em>me thing</em>.</p>
<p>I slept with it all night, with no ill effects, and 12 hours later I didn't notice it at all.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes... I showered with it on. No big deal.</p>
<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>It's only been one day, but I've already been surprised that my blook sugar seems to be fairly uneven, though
I'm pretty consistently in the 70-140mg/dL range that the app says is normal. Oh, and the app &amp;mdadsh; it's really
well-designed (imho) and very easy to use, though it's crammed full of &quot;easy-to-understand&quot; health benefit videos
that tell you to eat more protein, eat more veggies, and lay off the donuts.</p>
<p>I have seen a spike at every meal today (breakfast, lunch &amp; dinner), though the biggest spike was at dinner where
I had a 130+ grams of carbs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>So far so good... it's <em>intersting</em>, but I'm not yet sure how <em>actionable</em> this information is. Let's continue &amp;
see what happens in a few more days.</p>
<p>P.S. My CGM showed up on a day that I also started feeling sick ‚òπÔ∏è, so I haven't incorporated any exercise yet. Hopefully
that happens soon. ü§û</p>
