<p>One of the things that I lost when moving this site over to a static site was
the comments integration -- I was formerly using <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>.</p>
<p>I've debated on whether or not it makes sense to try implementing that here as well. Honestly, I got very littler interaction on this site, and it was either questions that I frequently missed or the random &quot;OK, thanks&quot; -- which is nice. I'm not sure independent writers like me even need comments, but it's a part of the early web that I miss, and one that I think has been killed off by social media.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should this site even have comments? Let me know in the ... uhm. Social medias? Slack? Email? (please don't)</p>
