<p>Today, I completed my second-ever <em>organized race</em>. It was the
Winter Off Road Race Series 3k in Overton
Park. The weather was pretty <em>amazing</em> (34ÂºF and raining), but I dressed
for it and had a great time.</p>
<p>Being only my second race, there's a few things that I thought were interesting
about this particular race.</p>
<ol>
<li>Lots of kids! I was somewhat amazed at the number of kids that ran this race;
many of them probably around 10-12 years old.</li>
<li>A surprising number of people under-dress for cold weather. There are always
the <em>tough</em> people who run in freezing weather wearing shorts and short
sleves, but I also saw a number of people who were probably wearing nothing
more than tights and a light jacket. I heard lots of people complaining
about the cold. Maybe I overdid it with <em>longjohns</em> and extra layers, but
I felt quite toasty warm.</li>
<li>The were a <em>lot</em> of people at this race. I don't have an exact count, but
there's definitely a thriving community of runners in the Memphis area. It's
pretty awesome to be a part of it.</li>
<li>A 3k (~1.8miles) is a really short race. My typical run is usually about
3 miles, so this went by really quickly. It <em>did</em> give me a chance to turn
up the speed a little, which is something I rarely do.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a really good time running this race, and I'm looking forward to the next
in the series: A 5k at Stanky Creek.</p>
