<p>This weekend is GiveCamp Memphis, and I'm
pretty excited to be a part of it. It's hosted this year by
Cowork Memphis, which is a pretty great local
coworking space.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with GiveCamp, it's a weekend-long event where the
<em>technically-inclined</em> donate their time and skills to a select group of
local noprofit organizations. The end results may include anything from new
logos, to new web designs, to brand-new applications.</p>
<p>Even though this will be the third year for GiveCamp weekend, this will be my
first year participating. As far as I can tell, the overall goal is this:</p>
<p><strong>Help people be better at being awesome.</strong></p>
<p>I'm not exactly sure what's in store for the weekend, but I do know that
infrastructure won't be a problem thanks to the generosity of Rackspace.</p>
<p>Now, if you know me, you know I'm a fan of Rackspace's services (I've
written in the past
about CloudFiles),
so I'm happy about having some free CloudServers to power a few local <em>Good Causes</em>.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out Rackspace's offerenings lately, consider taking a
look at their Developer Discount Program.
You can get $300 in free cloud services ($50/month for six months).</p>
<p>To borrow the Rackspace tagline, <em>&quot;Go make something awesome, on us&quot;</em>:
