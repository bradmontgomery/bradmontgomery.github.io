<p>Yesterday, I decided (mostly on a whim) to run the St Jude Memphis Marathon. It's
a race supporting St. Jude Children's research hospital which provides treatment
and research for major childhood illnesses such as Cancer and leukemia.</p>
<p>The <em>really</em> cool thing about St Jude is that they provide treatment that is 100%
free of charge to the families that suffer through these diseases. From their
website, &quot;Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel,
housing and food â€“ because all a family should worry about is helping their
child live.&quot;</p>
<p>That's why I'm happy to spend my time, and my money to support their mission.
I've got just over a month to figure out how to run nonstop for 26.2 miles (that's
42.2 kilometers)! AND, I could use your help!</p>
<p>You can join me is supporting this unique organization. Just donate $10, today,
and help me find a cure for childhood cancer and other catastrophic diseases.</p>
