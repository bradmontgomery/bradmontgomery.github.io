<p><strong>I'm officially a student!</strong> August marked the beginning of a new semester for me, and this time I'm a full-time student. After being on the faculty side of things for a while, I'm actually having a great time being a student again. One of the major benefits of being a student is that I'm actually getting to dive into that never-ending list of technology tools that I've been wanting to learn how to use!</p>
<p>Just to name a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> - I'm writing as much code as I possibly can in Python. I've used python minimally in the past, but it's actually nice to start working on larger projects using it. I don't really like to get into religious debates about languages, but Python does feel nice!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pygame.org">Pygame</a> - I'm not building a game (yet), but it does make a nice foundation for putting pictures on a screen!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm">PIL</a> - the Python Image Library offers an Excellent way to to Image manipulation!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://twistedmatrix.com">Twisted</a> - if you EVER need to build an event-driven network application from the ground up... use this!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a> - GAhh! Why haven't I learned this before... there's a lot to learn!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Luckily, there's <a href="http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/">PyOpenGL</a>!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That should get me started!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-326716395189621856?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
