<p><em>This was originally a guest post that appeared on Nibletz. The original link is here: <a href="http://nibletz.com/2013/02/08/minimum-working-guest-post/">http://nibletz.com/2013/02/08/minimum-working-guest-post/</a></em></p>
<p>I've been pondering this post for a long time. Any student of startups is
probably familiar with the phrase <em>Minimum Viable Product</em>. It's really a
simple idea, and I think it embodies an important philosophy for anyone starting
a company. The idea is that your <em>product</em> (whatever it is; e.g. a service, a
physical thing, or some software) should be as small as possible, but still be
a working, viable product that customers will buy.</p>
<p>The concept is fairly easy to understand, and I don't really think anyone
misudnerstands the idea. However, the <em>execution</em> of that idea is incredibly
difficult. Who knows why this is the case, but I'm going to postulate that
the terminology is getting in the way.</p>
<p>Let's get some definitions out of the way.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum</strong>. The least or smallest amount possible.</li>
<li><strong>Viable</strong>. Capable of working successfully.</li>
<li><strong>Product</strong>. An article or substance that is created or refined for sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't really think anyone has a problem with these terms individually, but put
them together, and I think many people have wildly varying interpretations of
their definitions. One reason, I think, is that people unknowingly emphasize
the wrong words. Let's break it down even further.</p>
<h2>Minimum</h2>
<p>This may be the most important word. Yet, I think it often gets the least amount
of emphasis. Honestly, if I were to change the phrase (and I am!), I'd keep this
word. It's perfect. We want to do the smallest amount of work possible, but
we need to strongly emphasize that.</p>
<p>This is hard to do. People like to make things more complex than they need to be.</p>
<h2>Viable</h2>
<p>Here's where things start to get confusing. The problem is, that many
entrepreneurs (especially first-timers--myself, included!) very rarely
agree on what <em>will work</em>. It's also very tempting to try to build a solution
without fully understanding the problem.</p>
<p>I say it's OK to not fully understand what you're doing (that's what startups
are all about!), so it's even more important to adjust your definiton of
<em>viable</em>. And, you know what? It's much smaller than you realize.</p>
<h2>Product</h2>
<p>This is where things really get confusing. When you say the word <em>product</em>,
many people start thinking <em>features</em>! Seriously, go to a business guy, an
engineer, or anyone that calls themselves an entrepreneur; sit down and
brainstorm a new &quot;product&quot;. Start making a bulleted list of all the <em>features</em>
that you'd like to see, and then tell me how many pages you have after an hour.</p>
<p>That's the problem. People envision a <em>product</em> as a fully-featured, complete,
does-it-all-with-bells-and-whistles... thing. As soon as you speak the word
product, you've already started having feature-creep, and you've already
forgotten that all-important adjective: <em>minimum</em>.</p>
<h2>Build a Minimum Working Thing</h2>
<p>I've complained long enough, so now I'm going to propose a solution. In the
tech-startup world, I suggest that we ditch the phrase <em>Minimum Viable Product</em>,
and adopt the phrase <em>Minimum Working Thing</em>.</p>
<p>Again, let's break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minimum</strong>. Do the least amount of work possible. This is important! You
know why, right? If you're in a startup, you're going to have to go back
to the drawing board. You're going to have to re-work some things. Build
less up front in order to save yourself some time later on.</li>
<li><strong>Working</strong>. Deploy something that <em>works</em>. Remember, you're
just as interested in failure as you are in success. Your first few
iterations don't have to launch your company into success. They have to teach
you the direction in which you need to travel. If people can use it to do
<em>something</em>, then it's working. It doesn't have to be successful.</li>
<li><strong>Thing</strong>. Don't build a product. Don't build features. Just build a <em>thing</em>
Yes, I'm being intentionally vague, because your thing may be very different
from someone else's thing. In fact, take that long list of features that you
think your product needs, and circle the first item on the list. That's your
<em>thing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it. Ultimately, forget what you think you need to build.
Instead, build something really small that <em>works</em>, and let your customers
start using it. Then, pay close attention to what they do and how they use your
<em>minimum working thing</em>. They'll guide you the rest of the way.</p>
