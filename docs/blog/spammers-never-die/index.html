<p>I've recently received a lot of spam through my <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=contact">contact form</a>, and it's starting to get on my nerves. Apparently the spammers have noticed that many developers are trying to thwart their attempts to sneak extra header information into PHP's <a href="http://php.net/mail">mail function</a>, so they've resorted to spamming websites directly! (or am I the only one?)</p>
<p>The messages I've been getting actually include a long list of URLs of the form: [URL=http:www.whatever.com]whatever[/URL], so I'm guessing some web app that uses this type of markup has a security hole... Time to patch that up developers!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-476539276586140598?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
