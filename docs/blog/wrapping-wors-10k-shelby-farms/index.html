<p>Today marks the end of the 2014 Winter Off Road Race Series.
The race was a 10K at Shelby Farms, and
while I've run this distance several times in the past, I think this particular
race might have been my best (just over 51 minutes).</p>
<p>It helps when you're having fun ;)</p>
<p>Prior to signing up for this series, I'd know about MRTC,
but I'd never participated in any of their smaller events (and the 2012 St.
Jude Half has been the *only* event prior to these). I have to admit that this
series has been so much fun, that I'll definitely be running more of these
kinds of races!</p>
