<p>Well, I've tried to make some California rolls. I think they turned out OK. Not the prettiest rolls, but they tasted good... maybe I shouldn't have eaten them all, though!</p>

<p>These were made with the following ingredients: * 1 cup of rice. (most recipes call for short grain rice, but I used long grain rice)</p>
<ul>
<li>1Tbsp of Rice vinegar</li>
<li>dash of salt</li>
<li>Nori</li>
<li>Carrots</li>
<li>Cucumber</li>
<li>Imitation crab meat (or real crab meat if you have it)</li>
<li>1 Avacado</li>
</ul>
<p>Boil 1 and 3/4 cups of water and salt. Once the water has come to a boil, add the rice, cover, and reduce to a simmer for 15 minutes. While simmering, julienne (or slice very thinly) carrots and cucumber. Chop crabmeat.</p>
<p>Once rice has finished, mix in the rice vinegar, and let cool for 10 minutes. Spread a thin layer of rice on the Nori, and top the rice with a small amount of carrots, cucumber, and crab, then roll tightly. Slice into thin pieces!</p>
<p>Enjoy with wasabi, soy sauce and pickled ginger!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1071652847642456889?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
