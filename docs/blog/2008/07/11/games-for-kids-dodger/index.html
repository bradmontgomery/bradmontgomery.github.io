<p>I've always thought it would be fun to build video games, and when my daughters were born, I knew I would eventually want to build some simple games that they could enjoy while they're young. My original attempt at this lead me to <a href="http://pygame.org">pygame</a>, and the result was a simple alphabet/number game that plopped letters and numbers on the screen (very similar to <a href="http://alphababy.sourceforge.net/">AlphaBaby</a>, but not nearly as good!). Unfortunately, I never continued to develop that one.</p>
<p>Since my oldest daughter (who is now 5) has recently discovered <a href="http://gcompris.net/">GCompris</a>, I thought I'd give the game-writing another chance. This has resulted in <a href="http://bradmontgomery.net/show.php?page=project_kidgames">dodger</a>, which is also my first attempt at using <a href="http://pyglet.org/">pyglet</a>. I know it can't compete with GCompris, but hopefully my daughter will like it.</p>
<p>I've released it under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">CC</a> license, so feel free to grab a copy, play it, use it, learn from it or whatever... Enjoy.<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2733020526160702993?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
