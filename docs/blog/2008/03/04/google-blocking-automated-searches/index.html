<p>This morning I was writing a little python, and I used Firefox's Google toolbar to search for <a href="http://sorry.google.com/sorry/?continue=http://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Disalnum%26ie%3Dutf-8%26oe%3Dutf-8%26aq%3Dt%26rls%3Dcom.ubuntu:en-US:official%26client%3Dfirefox-a">isalnum</a>. The strange thing about this, though, is that Google didn't do the search! Instead they gave me a message saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're sorry...but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily I could type in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">captcha</a> and continue the search. This really caught me offguard, though, so I decided to experiment a little. I had been logged in to my <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail</a> account t the time, so I tried clearing the cookies and cache from my browser. I searched for &quot;python isapha&quot;, and I got the same &quot;We're sorry...&quot; message. But this time, there was no captcha! I also tried searching for other terms (including &quot;dogs&quot;), all with same result.</p>
<p>So what happens if I don't have a Google account? I suddenly can't use their search engine?</p>
<p>So this got me thinking... Is the state of malware so bad that we'll eventually have to validate our identity before using a search engine?<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1740503720891335819?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
