<p>I guess I'm still a relatively new Mac User, but I consider myself fairly technical and probably more savvy that your typical Mac user (though there are a lot of mac users who are far more savvy than I!)</p>
<p><img src="http://bradmontgomery.net/images/dock_mirror.png" alt="I can see my cursor in the Dock!" />Imagine my surprise when, while working tonight, I discovered that the Dock in Leopard is a Mirror! Yes, I'd noticed the reflection of the Icons, but tonight, I actually saw my cursor (in Terminal) moving as I typed... that caught my attention! At first I though, &quot;well that's just amazing!&quot; I had to wonder just how much work went into making that happen. Then, I discovered that <a href="http://forums.macnn.com/90/mac-os-x/352053/annoying-dock-mirror-removal-in-leopard/">some people don't like this</a>!</p>
<p>Oh well. To each his own...<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-2356803099596722527?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
