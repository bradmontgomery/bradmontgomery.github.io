<p>A recent thread on the OpenCV mailing list (entitled: &quot;Tracking laser dots&quot;)
discussed techniques that could be used to track the dot from a laser pointer.
This sounded like something fun, so I finally got around to trying it out.
Essentially this could be done acheived by the following algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab the video frame.</li>
<li>Convert the video frame to the HSV color space.</li>
<li>Split the frame into individual components (separate images for H, S, and V).</li>
<li>Apply a threshold to each compenent (hopefully keeping just the dot from
the laser). It was originally suggested that just the Hue component be used
to search for the laser's dot, but I actually got several false positives
doing this. Therefore, using Value in addition to Hue gave me a more
reliable result. I can see where finding good threshold values for all 3
components would be a good approach in some situations.</li>
<li>Finally, perform an AND operation on the 3 images (which &quot;should&quot; cut down
on false positives)</li>
</ol>
<p>I should note that my testing was performed using a red laser pointer and a
large white sheet of paper in an well-lit office. Since I was only tracking the
dot on the paper, this turned out to be a fairly easy task to accomplish.
Finding good threshold values in other situations would be much more difficult.</p>
