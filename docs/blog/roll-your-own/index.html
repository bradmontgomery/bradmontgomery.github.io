<p>With all the good FOSS CMS software out there (like <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> and <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>), I sometimes wonder why I take the time to &quot;roll my own&quot;...</p>
<p>For all of you that subscribe to the feed (what, like 0), you might have noticed that it hasn't been updated lately. That's because I wrote some stuff to put by blogs in a database (<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>! - overkill is good!), but I'm just now finishing it so that the feed gets updated.</p>
<p>So, back to those CMS's... they all use PHP+MySQL, which is a good combination, but they're WAY more than I need! (Disregard the postgresql comment). Is there a CMS/Blog system that's easy to install, has a simple back-end, and is geared to an individual? Is anybody using <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> to run their blog?</p>
<p>Maybe I should clean up my code and open it up. Any takers?<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-1802614619464063852?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
