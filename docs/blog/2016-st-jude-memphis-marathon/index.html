<p>It's been exactly one week since I participated in the St. Jude Memphis Marathon, and I wanted to take a moment to say *thank you* to everyone who helped me get so close to my fundraising goal. Together, we raised $1435 of $1500, and I'm really happy about that (although, <a href="http://heroes.stjude.org/bkmontgomery">you can still give up 'till January</a>!).</p>
<p>As for the race, well... I'm glad I ran it. This year, I've run a 50k, a 50-miler, and this marathon. Unfortunately the marathon was my least favorite of the three. Don't get me wrong: I love this race, and I love what it stands for. It's just the first race that I've had real issues with cramping. Basically, here's how it broke down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mile 1 - 10: Yeah, I'm feeling great! I'm gonna crush this thing.</li>
<li>Mile 11-17: Hrmm, I may have started off too fast. I'm suddenly feeling a little tired.</li>
<li>Miles 18-26: _i am nothing but cramps, please stop running_.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is first race where I just wanted to stop. I guess this happens to everyone, and it's no fun. I'm not even sure what I did wrong, and I've been pretty consistent with training &amp; nutrition for the past few months. Head over to <a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/1470476516">Garmin Connect</a> and you can see where things fall apart. I did however, set nearly a 15-minute PR with this, by finishing in just over four hours: 4:14. So there's that.</p>
<p>Oh well. _C'est la vie_.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can beat the 4-hour mark next year.</p>
<h2>And now for some geeky stuff</h2>
<p>A couple days after the race (once my legs stopped hurting), I went looking for the race results, and I realized they would be pretty easy feed into a python script and generate some interesting aggregate stats. So, this happened:</p>
<p>I posted this to a Facebook group, and my friend <a href="http://www.liftheavyrunlong.com/von/">Von</a> thought it'd be fun to see this kind of data for the entire history of the race. So, I grabbed as many of the data files as I could and started analyzing them. You can can check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nSFo_WKVWTufqSwoTxWbe2013KVXTqk7gE2Pj-JEbg/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet</a> with some cool data like, _average pace_, _average finish time_, and _male/female participation_ numbers. And if you're interested, the <a href="https://github.com/bradmontgomery/st-jude-marathon">code to analyze this stuff is on github</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a a few charts to whet your appetite:</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't get Google Sheets to recognize things like <code>9:50</code> and <code>4:44:17</code> as durations nor could I get them to plot those values. So I ended up converting pace and finish times to seconds. Still, it's interesting stuff.</p>
