<p>I run a dual-boot Ubuntu64<a href="#one">[1]</a> and Windows XP system. The windows partition really exists for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament_2004">single purpose</a>, and I occasionally just reboot the machine, choose the XP partition from the Grub menu, and all is well.</p>
<p>However, a few weeks ago, I upgraded Ubuntu, but when I rebooted the machine and chose the XP partition, I noticed the sound<a href="#two">[2]</a> stopped working. What!? The audio worked fine in ubuntu!</p>
<p>The Secret: <strong>I had to <em>completely power down the machine</em> before booting into Windows.</strong> Then, audio works just fine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't discover this until I'd re-installed the windows drivers (which didn't work), reformatted/reinstalled windows and all drivers (which only worked because I powered down in the process), <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/">fixed my grub boot loader</a>, and incorrectly assumed the problem was fixed until I booted back into Ubuntu and back into Windows only to find that the problem remained.</p>
<p>Sheesh. So, if this has happened to you, I'm sure you've found the myriad article on how to get sound working in Linux... which for me, has always worked just fine.</p>
