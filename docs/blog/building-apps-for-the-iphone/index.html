<p>So there was this little get-together called <a href="http://barcamp.org/iPhoneDevCamp">iPhoneDevCamp</a> last weekend (July 6-8, 2007), and since I'm just over 2000 miles from San Francisco, I missed out. However, in just under a week, there seems to have been a flood of great iPhone applications. To find out what I mean, just check out a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=iphone+applications&amp;btnG=Search">google search</a>, OR, head right on over to the <a href="http://iphoneapplicationlist.com/">iPhone Application List</a>.</p>
<p>So, in such a short time since the iPhone's release, how have so many applications been built? I blame <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/">Joe Hewitt</a>. His User Interface library, <strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/">iUI</a></strong>, makes building basic apps for the iPhone a cinch. So what is iUI? Well, to quote from his <a href="http://www.joehewitt.com/blog/introducing_iui.php">blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its goal is simply to turn ordinary standards-based HTML into a polished, usable interface that meets the high standards set by Apple's own native iPhone apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, there you have it. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iui/source">Try it out!</a> I certainly will!<img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4123748873183487963-324645953644061889?l=bradmontgomery.blogspot.com" alt="" /></p>
